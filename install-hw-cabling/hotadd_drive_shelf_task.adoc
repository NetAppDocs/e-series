[.lead]
You can add a new drive shelf while power is still applied to the other components of the storage system. You can configure, reconfigure, add, or relocate storage system capacity without interrupting user access to data.

Due to the complexity of this procedure, the following is recommended:

* Read all steps before beginning the procedure.
* Ensure hot adding a drive shelf is the procedure you need.

This procedure applies to hot adding a DE212C, DE224C, or DE460C drive shelf to an E5700, EF570, E2800, EF280, or EF300 controller shelf.

If you are cabling an older controller shelf to a DE212C, DE224C, or DE460, see https://mysupport.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2859057[Adding IOM Drive Shelves to an Existing E27XX, E56XX, or EF560 Controller Shelf].

IMPORTANT: To maintain system integrity, you must follow the procedure exactly in the order presented.

== Step 1: Prepare to add the drive shelf

[.lead]
Before you hot add a drive shelf, you must check for critical events and check the status of the IOMs.

===== Before you begin

* The power source for your storage system must be able to accommodate the power requirements of the new drive shelf. For the power specification for your drive shelf, see the https://hwu.netapp.com/Controller/Index?platformTypeId=2357027[Hardware Universe].
* The cabling pattern for the existing storage system must match one of the applicable schemes shown in this procedure.

===== Steps

. In SANtricity System Manager, select *Support* > *Support Center* > *Diagnostics*.
. Select *Collect Support Data*.
+
The Collect Support Data dialog box appears.

. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name support-data.7z. The data is not automatically sent to technical support.

. Select *Support* > *Event Log*.
+
The Event Log page displays the event data.

. Select the heading of the *Priority* column to sort critical events to the top of the list.
. Review the system critical events for events that have occurred in the last two to three weeks, and verify that any recent critical events have been resolved or otherwise addressed.
+
NOTE: If unresolved critical events have occurred within the previous two to three weeks, stop the procedure and contact technical support. Continue the procedure only when the issue is resolved.

. Select *Hardware*.
. Select the *IOMs (ESMs)* icon.
+
image::../media/sam1130_ss_hardware_iom_icon.gif[]
+
The Shelf Component Settings dialog box appears with the *IOMs (ESMs)* tab selected.

. Make sure that the status shown for each IOM/ESM is _Optimal_.
. Click *Show more settings*.
. Confirm that the following conditions exist:
 ** The number of ESMs/IOMs detected matches the number of ESMs/IOMs installed in the system and that for each drive shelf.
 ** Both of the ESMs/IOMs show that communication is OK.
 ** The data rate is 12Gb/s for DE212C, DE224C, and DE460C drive shelves or 6 Gb/s for other drive trays.

== Step 2: Install the drive shelf and apply power

[.lead]
You install a new drive shelf or a previously installed drive shelf, turn on the power, and check for any LEDs that require attention.

===== Steps

. If you are installing a drive shelf that has previously been installed in a storage system, remove the drives. The drives must be installed one at a time later in this procedure.
+
If the installation history of the drive shelf that you are installing is unknown, you should assume that it has been previously installed in a storage system.

. Install the drive shelf in the rack that holds the storage system components.
+
IMPORTANT: See the installation instructions for your model for the full procedure for physical installation and power cabling. The installation instructions for your model includes notes and warnings that you must take into account to safely install a drive shelf.

. Power on the new drive shelf, and confirm that no amber attention LEDs are illuminated on the drive shelf. If possible, resolve any fault conditions before you continue with this procedure.

== Step 3: Cable your system

[.lead]
If you are cabling an older controller shelf to a DE212C, DE224C, or DE460, see https://mysupport.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2859057[Adding IOM Drive Shelves to an Existing E27XX, E56XX, or EF560 Controller Shelf].

=== Connect the drive shelf--E2800 and E5700

[.lead]
You connect the drive shelf to controller A, confirm IOM status, and then connect the drive shelf to controller B.

===== Steps
