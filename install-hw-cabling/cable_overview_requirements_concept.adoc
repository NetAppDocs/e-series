summary: You can cable a host directly to a controller or use switches to connect a host to a controller. If your storage system includes one or more drive shelves, you must cable them to your controller shelf. You can add a new drive shelf while power is still applied to other components of the storage system. In addition, you can connect your storage system to a network for out-of-band management.
