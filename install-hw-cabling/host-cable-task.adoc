You can cable a host directly to a controller (direct-attached topology) or use switches (switch topology) to connect a host to a controller.

== Cabling for a direct-attached topology

A direct-attached topology connects host adapters directly to controllers in your storage system.

To help ensure maximum performance, use all available host adapter ports.

.One host with two HBAs 

The following figure shows an example of one host with two HBA installed.

.One host with two HBAs (alternate cabling) 

The following figure shows an example of one host with two HBA installed.

.Two hosts with two HBAs per host

The following figure shows an example of two hosts each with two HBAs installed.

== Cabling for a switch topology

A switch topology uses switches to connect hosts to the controllers in your storage system. The switch must support the connection type used between the host and the controller.

The following figure shows an example connection. For switches that provide provisioning capability, you should isolate each initiator and target pair.

*(2)* _Connect each switch directly to the host ports on the controllers. To help ensure maximum performance, use all available host adapter ports._
