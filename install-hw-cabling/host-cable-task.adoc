You can cable a host directly to a controller (direct-attached topology) or use switches (switch topology) to connect a host to a controller.

== Cabling for a direct-attached topology

A direct-attached topology connects host adapters directly to controllers in your storage system.

The following figure shows an example connection. To help ensure maximum performance, use all available host adapter ports.

=== Two hosts and two controllers

== Cabling for a switch topology

A switch topology uses switches to connect hosts to the controllers in your storage system. The switch must support the connection type used between the host and the controller.

The following figure shows an example connection.

For switches that provide provisioning capability, you should isolate each initiator and target pair.
