:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You can replace a failed controller canister in a simplex (single-controller) configuration, for the following controller shelves:

* E4012 controller shelf
* E4024 controller shelf

.About this task

The controller canister contains a controller card, a battery. When you replace a failed controller canister, you must remove the battery from the original controller canister and install it in the replacement controller canister.

.Before you begin

Make sure you have the following:

* A replacement controller canister with the same part number as the controller canister you are replacing.
* An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* Labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* A management station with a browser that can access SANtricity System Manager for the controller. (To open the System Manager interface, point the browser to the controller's domain name or IP address.)

== Step 1: Prepare to replace controller
Prepare to replace a controller canister by saving the drive security key, backing up the configuration, and collecting support data. Then, you can stop host I/O operations and power down the controller shelf.

.Steps

. If possible, make a note of which version of SANtricity OS software is currently installed on the controller. Open SANtricity System Manager and select *Support › Upgrade Center › View Software and Firmware Inventory*.
. If the Drive Security feature is enabled, be sure a saved key exists and that you know the pass phrase required to install it.
+
CAUTION: *Possible loss of data access* — If all drives in the storage array are security enabled, the new controller will not be able to access the storage array until you unlock the secured drives using the Enterprise Management Window in SANtricity Storage Manager.
+
To save the key (might not be possible, depending on the state of the controller):

.. From SANtricity System Manager, select *Settings › System*.
.. Under *Drive security key management*, select *Back Up Key*.
.. In the *Define a pass phrase/Re-enter pass phrase* fields, enter and confirm a pass phrase for this backup copy.
.. Click *Backup*.
.. Record your key information in a secure location, and then click *Close*.

. Back up the storage array's configuration database using SANtricity System Manager.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to restore your configuration. The system will save the current state of the RAID configuration database, which includes all data for volume groups and disk pools on the controller.

** From System Manager:

.. *Select Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Configuration Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *configurationData-<arrayName>-<dateTime>.7z*.

** Alternatively, you can back up the configuration database by using the following CLI command:
+
`save storageArray dbmDatabase sourceLocation=onboard contentType=all file="filename";`

. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to troubleshoot the issue. The system will save inventory, status, and performance data about your storage array in a single file.

.. *Select Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Support Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *support-data.7z*.
. Ensure that no I/O operations are occurring between the storage array and all connected hosts. For example, you can perform these steps:

** Stop all processes that involve the LUNs mapped from the storage to the hosts.
** Ensure that no applications are writing data to any LUNs mapped from the storage to the hosts.
** Unmount all file systems associated with volumes on the array.
+
NOTE: The exact steps to stop host I/O operations depend on the host operating system and the configuration, which are beyond the scope of these instructions. If you are not sure how to stop host I/O operations in your environment, consider shutting down the host.
+
CAUTION: *Possible data loss* — If you continue this procedure while I/O operations are occurring, you might lose data.

. Wait for any data in cache memory to be written to the drives.
+
The green Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is on when cached data needs to be written to the drives. You must wait for this LED to turn off.
. From the home page of SANtricity System Manager, select *View Operations in Progress*.
. Confirm that all operations have completed before continuing with the next step.
. Turn off both power switches on the controller shelf.
. Wait for all LEDs on the controller shelf to turn off.
. Select *Recheck* from the Recovery Guru, and confirm that the *OK to remove* field in the Details area displays *Yes*, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.
Data on the storage array will not be accessible until you replace the controller canister.

== Step 2: Remove failed controller

Replace the failed canister with a new one.

.Steps

. Remove a controller canister.
.. Put on an ESD wristband or take other antistatic precautions.
.. Label each cable that is attached to the controller canister.
.. Disconnect all the cables from the controller canister.
+
CAUTION: To prevent degraded performance, do not twist, fold, pinch, or step on the cables.
.. If needed, remove the SFPs transceivers.
.. Confirm that the Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is off.
+
The green Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is on when cached data needs to be written to the drives. You must wait for this LED to turn off before removing the controller canister.
.. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller canister from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller canister out of the chassis.
.. Turn the controller canister over and place it on a flat, stable surface.
.. Open the cover by pressing the blue buttons on the sides of the controller canister to release the cover, and then rotate the cover up and off of the controller canister.

.. Verify that the battery is not plugged into the replacement controller canister.
.. Install the DIMMs in the replacement controller in the same place they were in the impaired controller:
... Push carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the ejector tabs snap into place over the notches at the ends of the DIMM.
+
The DIMM fits tightly in the slot, but should go in easily. If not, realign the DIMM with the slot and reinsert it.
+
NOTE: Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.
.. Repeat these steps for the other DIMM.



. Install the battery into the replacement controller canister.
.. Plug the battery plug back into the socket on the controller canister.
+
Make sure that the plug locks down into the battery socket on the motherboard.
.. Aligning the battery with the holding brackets on the sheet metal side wall.
.. Slide the battery pack down until the battery latch engages and clicks into the opening on the side wall.
.. Reinstall the controller canister cover and lock it into place.


== Step 3: Install new controller

Install the replacement controller canister into the system chassis.

The system might update system firmware when it boots. Do not abort this process. The procedure requires you to interrupt the boot process, which you can typically do at any time after prompted to do so. However, if the system updates the system firmware when it boots, you must wait until after the update is complete before interrupting the boot process.
If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

.Steps

. If you have not already done so, replace the cover on the controller canister.
. Turn the controller canister.
. Align the end of the controller canister with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller canister halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller canister in the chassis until instructed to do so.
. Complete the reinstallation of the controller canister:
.. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller canister in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller canister into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller begins to boot as soon as it is seated in the chassis.
..If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
.. Bind the cables to the cable management device with the hook and loop strap.


. If the original controller used DHCP for the IP address, locate the MAC address on the label on the back of the replacement controller. Ask your network administrator to associate the DNS/network and IP address for the controller you removed with the MAC address for the replacement controller.
+
NOTE: If the original controller did not use DHCP for the IP address, the new controller will adopt the IP address of the controller you removed. 


== Step 4: Complete controller replacement

Power on the controller shelf, collect support data, and resume operations.

.Steps

. Turn on the two power switches at the back of the controller shelf.

** Do not turn off the power switches during the power-on process, which typically takes 90 seconds or less to complete.
** The fans in each shelf are very loud when they first start up. The loud noise during start-up is normal.
. Place controller online.
.. In System Manager, navigate to the *Hardware* page.
.. Select *Show back of controller*.
.. Select the replaced controller.
.. Select *Place online* from the drop-down list.
. As the controller boots, check the controller LEDs.

** The amber Attention LED on the controller turns on and then turns off, unless there is an error.
** The green Host Link LEDs turn on.

. If any of the controller shelf's Attention LEDs remain on, check that the controller canister has been installed correctly and that all cables are correctly seated. Reinstall the controller canister, if necessary.
+
NOTE: If you cannot resolve the problem, contact technical support.
. If the storage array has secure drives, import the drive security key; otherwise, go to the next step. Follow the appropriate procedure below for a storage array with all secure drives or a mix of secure and unsecure drives.
+
NOTE: _Unsecure drives_ are unassigned drives, global hot spare drives, or drives that are part of a volume group or a pool that is not secured by the Drive Security feature. Secure drives are assigned drives that are a part of a secured volume group or disk pool using Drive Security.

** *Only secured drives (no unsecure drives)*:
.. Access the storage array's command line interface (CLI).
.. Enter the following command to import the security key:
+
----
import storageArray securityKey file="C:/file.slk"
passPhrase="passPhrase";
----
+
where:

*** `C:/file.slk` represents the directory location and name of your drive security key
*** `passPhrase` is the pass phrase needed to unlock the file After the security key has been imported, the controller reboots, and the new controller adopts the saved settings for the storage array.

.. Go to the next step to confirm that the new controller is Optimal.

** *Mix of secure and unsecure drives*:

.. Collect the support bundle and open the storage array profile.
.. Find and record all the unsecure drives’ locations, which are found in the support bundle.
.. Power off the system.
.. Remove the unsecure drives.
.. Replace the controller.
.. Power on the system and wait for the seven-segment display to show the tray number.
.. From SANtricity System Manager, select *Settings › System*.
.. In the Security Key Management section, select *Create/Change Key* to create a new security key.
.. Select *Unlock Secure Drives* to import the security key you saved.
.. Run the `set allDrives nativeState` CLI command.
.. The controller will reboot automatically.
.. Wait for the controller to boot up and for the seven-segment display to show the tray number or a flashing L5.
.. Power off the system.
.. Reinstall the unsecure drives.
.. Reset the controller using SANtricity System Manager.
.. Power on the system and wait for the seven-segment display to show the tray number.
.. Go to the next step to confirm that the new controller is Optimal.

. From SANtricity System Manager, confirm that the new controller is Optimal.
.. Select *Hardware*.
.. For the controller shelf, select *Show back of shelf*.
.. Select the controller canister you replaced.
.. Select *View settings*.
.. Confirm that the controller's *Status* is Optimal.
.. If the status is not Optimal, highlight the controller, and select *Place Online*.

. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
.. Select *Support › Support Center › *Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Support Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *support-data.7z*.

.What's next?
Your controller replacement is complete. You can resume normal operations.
