:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You can replace a failed controller canister in a duplex (two-controller) configuration, for the following controller shelves:

* E4012 controller shelf
* E4024 controller shelf
* E4060 controller shelf

.About this task

The controller canister contains a controller card, a battery. When you replace a failed controller canister, you must remove the battery from the original controller canister and install it in the replacement controller canister.

.Before you begin

Make sure you have the following:

* A replacement controller canister with the same part number as the controller canister you are replacing.
* An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* Labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* A management station with a browser that can access SANtricity System Manager for the controller. (To open the System Manager interface, point the browser to the controller's domain name or IP address.)

== Step 1: Prepare to replace controller

Prepare to replace the controller by verifying that the replacement controller canister has the correct FRU part number, backing up the configuration, and collecting support data. If the controller is still online, you must take it offline.

.Steps

. Unpack the new controller canister, and set it on a flat, static-free surface.
+
Save the packing materials to use when shipping the failed controller canister.
. Locate the MAC address and FRU part number labels on the back of the controller canister.
. From SANtricity System Manager, locate the replacement part number for the controller canister you are replacing.
+
When a controller has a fault and needs to be replaced, the replacement part number is displayed in the Details area of the Recovery Guru. If you need to find this number manually, follow these steps:

.. Select *Hardware*.
.. Locate the controller shelf, which is marked with the controller icon.
.. Click the controller icon.
.. Select the controller, and click *Next*.
.. On the *Base* tab, make a note of the *Replacement Part Number* for the controller.
. Confirm that the replacement part number for the failed controller is the same as the FRU part number for the replacement controller.
+
CAUTION: *Possible loss of data access* — If the two part numbers are not the same, do not attempt this procedure. The presence of mismatched controllers will cause the new controller to lock down when you bring it online.
. Back up the storage array's configuration database using SANtricity System Manager.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to restore your configuration. The system will save the current state of the RAID configuration database, which includes all data for volume groups and disk pools on the controller.

** From System Manager:
.. Select *Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Configuration Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *configurationData-<arrayName>-<dateTime>.7z*.

** Alternatively, you can back up the configuration database by using the following CLI command:
+
----
save storageArray dbmDatabase sourceLocation=onboard contentType=all file="filename";
----

. If the controller is not already offline, take it offline now using SANtricity System Manager.

** From SANtricity System Manager:
.. Select *Hardware*.
.. If the graphic shows the drives, select *Show back of shelf* to show the controllers.
.. Select the controller that you want to place offline.
.. From the context menu, select *Place offline*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
+
NOTE: If you are accessing SANtricity System Manager using the controller you are attempting to take offline, a SANtricity System Manager Unavailable message is displayed. Select Connect to an alternate network connection to automatically access SANtricity System Manager using the other controller.

** Alternatively, you can take the controllers offline by using the following CLI commands:
+
*For controller A*: `set controller [a] availability=offline`
+
*For controller B*: `set controller [b] availability=offline`
. Wait for SANtricity System Manager to update the controller's status to offline.
+
CAUTION: Do not begin any other operations until after the status has been updated.
. Select *Recheck* from the Recovery Guru, and confirm that the *OK to remove* field in the Details area displays *Yes*, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.

== Step 2: Remove failed controller

Replace the failed canister with a new one.

.Steps

. Remove the controller canister.
.. Put on an ESD wristband or take other antistatic precautions.
.. Label each cable that is attached to the controller canister.
.. Disconnect all the cables from the controller canister.
+
CAUTION: To prevent degraded performance, do not twist, fold, pinch, or step on the cables.
.. If needed, remove the SFPs transceivers.
.. Confirm that the Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is off.
+
The green Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is on when cached data needs to be written to the drives. You must wait for this LED to turn off before removing the controller canister.
.. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller canister from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller canister out of the chassis.
.. Turn the controller canister over and place it on a flat, stable surface.

Make sure that the plug locks down into the battery socket on the motherboard.
.. Aligning the battery with the holding brackets on the sheet metal side wall.
.. Slide the battery pack down until the battery latch engages and clicks into the opening on the side wall.
.. Reinstall the controller canister cover and lock it into place.


== Step 3: Install new controller

Install the replacement controller canister into the system chassis.

The system might update system firmware when it boots. Do not abort this process. The procedure requires you to interrupt the boot process, which you can typically do at any time after prompted to do so. However, if the system updates the system firmware when it boots, you must wait until after the update is complete before interrupting the boot process.
If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

.Steps

. If you have not already done so, replace the cover on the controller canister.
. Turn the controller canister.
. Align the end of the controller canister with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller canister halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller canister in the chassis until instructed to do so.
. Complete the reinstallation of the controller canister:
.. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller canister in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller canister into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller begins to boot as soon as it is seated in the chassis.
..If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
.. Bind the cables to the cable management device with the hook and loop strap.


. If the original controller used DHCP for the IP address, locate the MAC address on the label on the back of the replacement controller. Ask your network administrator to associate the DNS/network and IP address for the controller you removed with the MAC address for the replacement controller.
+
NOTE: If the original controller did not use DHCP for the IP address, the new controller will adopt the IP address of the controller you removed. 


== Step 4: Complete controller replacement

Power on the controller shelf, collect support data, and resume operations.

.Steps

. Turn on the two power switches at the back of the controller shelf.

** Do not turn off the power switches during the power-on process, which typically takes 90 seconds or less to complete.
** The fans in each shelf are very loud when they first start up. The loud noise during start-up is normal.
. Place controller online.
.. In System Manager, navigate to the *Hardware* page.
.. Select *Show back of controller*.
.. Select the replaced controller.
.. Select *Place online* from the drop-down list.
. As the controller boots, check the controller LEDs.

** The amber Attention LED on the controller turns on and then turns off, unless there is an error.
** The Host Link LEDs might be on, blinking, or off, depending on the host interface.

. When the controller is back online, confirm that its status is Optimal and check the controller shelf's Attention LEDs.
+
If the status is not Optimal or if any of the Attention LEDs are on, confirm that all cables are correctly seated and the controller canister is installed correctly. If necessary, remove and reinstall the controller canister.
+
NOTE: If you cannot resolve the problem, contact technical support.
. If required, redistribute all volumes back to their preferred owner using SANtricity System Manager.
.. Select *Storage › Volumes*.
.. Select *More › Redistribute volumes*.
. Click *Hardware › Support › Upgrade Center* to ensure that the latest version of SANtricity OS software (controller firmware) is installed.
+
As needed, install the latest version.

. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
.. Select *Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Support Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *support-data.7z*.

.What's next?
Your controller replacement is complete. You can resume normal operations.
