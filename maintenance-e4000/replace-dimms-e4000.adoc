= Replace DIMMs in E4000
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You can replace a DIMM in the E4000 if when a memory mismatch is present, or if you have a failed DIMM.

.About this task

To replace a DIMM, you must verify the cache size of your controller, place the controller offline, remove the controller, remove the DIMMs, and install the new DIMMs in your controller. Then you can bring your controller back online and verify the storage array is working properly.

.Before you begin

* Make sure that no volumes are in use or that you have a multipath driver installed on all hosts using these volumes.
*  Make sure you have the following:
** A replacement DIMM.
** An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
** A flat, static free work area.
** Labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
** A management station with a browser that  can access SANtricity System Manager for the controller. (To open the System Manager interface, point the browser to the controller’s domain name or IP address.)

== Step 1: Determine if you need to replace a DIMM

Verify the cache size of your controller before replacing the DIMMS.

.Steps

. Access the Storage Array profile for the controller. From SANtricity System Manager, go to *Support* › *Support Center*. From the Support Resources page, select *Storage Array Profile*.
. Scroll down or use the Search field to locate the *Data Cache Module* information.
. If one of the following is present, note the DIMM’s location and continue with remaining procedures in this section to replace the DIMMs on your controller:
.. A failed DIMM, or a DIMM reporting *Data Cache Module* as not optimal.
.. A DIMM with a mismatched *Data Cache Module* capacity.

== Step 2: Place controller offline

Place the controller offline so you can safely remove and replace the DIMMs.

.Steps

. From SANtricity System Manager, review the details in the Recovery Guru to confirm that there is an issue with a mismatched memory and to ensure no other items must be addressed first.
. From the Details area of the Recovery Guru, determine which DIMM to replace.
. Back up the storage array’s configuration database using SANtricity System Manager.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to restore your configuration. The system will save the current state of the RAID configuration database, which includes all data for volume groups and disk pools on the controller.
+
* From System Manager:
+
.. Select *Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Configuration Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *configurationData-
<arrayName>-<dateTime>.7z*.
. If the controller is not already offline, take it offline now using SANtricity System Manager.
.. Select *Hardware*.
.. If the graphic shows the drives, select *Show back of shelf* to show the controllers.
.. Select the controller that you want to place offline.
.. From the context menu, select *Place offline*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
+
NOTE: If you are accessing SANtricity System Manager using the controller you are attempting to take offline, a SANtricity System Manager Unavailable message is displayed. Select *Connect to an alternate network connection* to automatically access SANtricity System Manager using the other controller.
. Wait for SANtricity System Manager to update the controller’s status to offline.
+
NOTE: Do not begin any other operations until after the status has been updated.
. Select *Recheck* from the Recovery Guru, and confirm that the OK to remove field in the Details area
displays Yes, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.

== Step 3: Remove controller canister

Remove the controller canister from the system and then remove the controller canister cover.

.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFPs (if needed) from the controller canister, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.
. Remove and set aside the cable management devices from the left and right sides of the controller canister.
. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller canister from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller canister out of the chassis.
. Turn the controller canister over and place it on a flat, stable surface.
. Open the cover by pressing the blue buttons on the sides of the controller canister to release the cover, and then rotate the cover up and off of the controller canister.

== Step 4: Replace the DIMMs

Locate the DIMM inside the controller, remove it, and replace it.

.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. You must perform a clean system shutdown before replacing system components to avoid losing unwritten data in the nonvolatile memory (NVMEM). The LED is located on the back of the controller canister.
. If the NVMEM LED is not flashing, there is no content in the NVMEM; you can skip the following steps and proceed to the next task in this procedure.
. If the NVMEM LED is flashing, there is data in the NVMEM and you must disconnect the battery to clear the memory:
.. Remove the battery from the controller canister by pressing the blue button on the side of the controller canister.
.. Slide the battery up until it clears the holding brackets, and then lift the battery out of the controller canister.
.. Locate the battery cable, press the clip on the battery plug to release the lock clip from the plug socket, and then unplug the battery cable from the socket.
.. Confirm that the NVMEM LED is no longer lit.
.. Reconnect the battery connector and recheck the LED on the back of the controller.
.. Unplug the battery cable.
. Locate the DIMMs on your controller canister.
. Note the orientation and location of the DIMM in the socket so that you can insert the replacement DIMM in the proper orientation.
. Eject the DIMM from its slot by slowly pushing apart the two DIMM ejector tabs on either side of the DIMM, and then slide the DIMM out of the slot.
+
The DIMM will rotate up a little.
. Rotate the DIMM as far as it will go, and then slide the DIMM out of the socket.
+
NOTE: Carefully hold the DIMM by the edges to avoid pressure on the components on the DIMM circuit board.
+

. Remove the replacement DIMM from the antistatic shipping bag, hold the DIMM by the corners, and align it to the slot.
+
The notch among the pins on the DIMM should line up with the tab in the socket.
. Insert the DIMM squarely into the slot.
+
The DIMM fits tightly in the slot, but should go in easily. If not, realign the DIMM with the slot and reinsert it.
+
NOTE: Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.
. Push carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the ejector tabs snap into place over the notches at the ends of the DIMM.
. Reconnect the battery:
.. Plug in the battery.
.. Make sure that the plug locks down into the battery power socket on the motherboard.
.. Align the battery with the holding brackets on the sheet metal side wall.
.. Slide the battery pack down until the battery latch engages and clicks into the opening on the side wall.
. Reinstall the controller canister cover.


== Step 5: Reinstall the controller canister

Reinstall the controller canister into the chassis.

.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. If you have not already done so, replace the cover on the controller canister.
. Turn the controller canister over and align the end with the opening in the chassis.
. Gently push the controller canister halfway into the system. Align the end of the controller canister with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller canister halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller canister in the chassis until instructed to do so.
. Recable the system, as needed.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.
. Complete the reinstallation of the controller canister:
.. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller canister in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller canister into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller begins to boot as soon as it is seated in the chassis.
.. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
.. Bind the cables to the cable management device with the hook and loop strap.
. Reboot the controller canister.
+
During the boot process, you might see the following prompts:
+
* A prompt warning of a system ID mismatch and asking to override the system ID.
* A prompt warning that when entering Maintenance mode in an HA configuration you must ensure that the healthy controller remains down. You can safely respond y to these prompts.


== Step 6: Complete DIMMs replacement

Place the controller online, collect support data, and resume operations.

.Steps

. Place controller online.
.. In System Manager, navigate to the Hardware page.
.. Select *Show back of controller*.
.. Select the controller with the replaced DIMMs.
.. Select *Place online* from the drop-down list.
. As the controller boots, check the controller LEDs.
+
When communication with the other controller is reestablished:

* The amber Attention LED remains on.
* The Host Link LEDs might be on, blinking, or off, depending on the host interface.
. When the controller is back online, confirm that its status is Optimal and check the controller shelf’s Attention LEDs.
+
If the status is not Optimal or if any of the Attention LEDs are on, confirm that all cables are correctly seated and the controller canister is installed correctly. If necessary, remove and reinstall the controller canister.
NOTE: If you cannot resolve the problem, contact technical support.
. Click *Hardware › Support › Upgrade Center* to ensure that the latest version of SANtricity OS is installed.
+
As needed, install the latest version.
. Verify that all volumes have been returned to the preferred owner.
.. Select *Storage › Volumes*. From the *All Volumes* page, verify that volumes are distributed to their preferred owners. Select *More › Change ownership* to view volume owners.
.. If volumes are all owned by preferred owner continue to Step 6.
.. If none of the volumes are returned, you must manually return the volumes. Go to *More › Redistribute volumes*.
.. If there is no Recovery Guru present or if following the Recovery Guru steps the volumes are still not returned to their preferred owners contact support.
. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
