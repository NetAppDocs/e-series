[.lead]
You can replace a power canister in an E4000 array with a 60-drive shelf, which include the following shelf types:

* E2860 controller shelf
* DE460C drive shelf

.About this task

Each 60-drive controller shelf or drive shelf includes two power canisters for power redundancy. If a power canister fails, you must replace it as soon as possible to ensure that the shelf has a redundant power source.

You can replace a power canister while your storage array is powered on and performing host I/O operations, as long as the second power canister in the shelf has an Optimal status and the *OK to remove* field in the Details area of the Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager displays *Yes*.

While you perform this task, the other power canister supplies power to both fans to ensure that the equipment does not overheat.

.Before you begin

* Review the details in the Recovery Guru to confirm that there is an issue with the power canister and select *Recheck* from the Recovery Guru to ensure no other items must be addressed first.
* Check that the amber Attention LED on the power canister is on, indicating that the canister has a fault. Contact technical support for assistance if both power canisters in the shelf have their amber Attention LEDs on.
* Make sure you have the following:
** A replacement power canister that is supported for your controller shelf or drive shelf model.
** An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.

== Step 1: Prepare to replace power canister

Prepare to replace a power canister in a 60-drive controller shelf or drive shelf.

.Steps

. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
 .. Select menu:Support[Support Center > Diagnostics].
 .. Select *Collect Support Data*.
 .. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *support-data.7z*.
. From SANtricity System Manager, determine which power canister has failed.
 .. Select *Hardware*.
 .. Look at the power image:../media/sam1130_ss_hardware_power_icon_maint-e2800.gif[] icon to the right of the *Shelf* drop-down lists to determine which shelf has the failed power canister.
+
If a component has failed, this icon is red.

 .. When you find the shelf with a red icon, select *Show back of shelf*.
 .. Select either power canister or the red power icon.
 .. On the *Power Supplies* tab, look at the statuses of the power canisters to determine which power canister must be replaced.
+
A component with a *Failed* status must be replaced.
+
CAUTION: If the second power canister in the shelf does not have *Optimal* status, do not attempt to hot-swap the failed power canister. Instead, contact technical support for assistance.
+
NOTE: You can also find information about the failed power canister in the Details area of the Recovery Guru, or you can review the information displayed for the shelf, or you can review the Event Log under Support and filter by Component Type.
. From the back of the storage array, look at the Attention LEDs to locate the power canister you need to remove.
+
You must replace the power canister that has its Attention LED on.

== Step 2: Remove failed power canister

Remove a failed power canister so you can replace it with a new one.

.Steps

. Put on antistatic protection.
. Unpack the new power canister, and set it on a level surface near the shelf.

Install a new power canister to replace the failed one.

.Steps

. Make sure the on/off switch of the new power canister is in the Off position.
. Using both hands, support and align the edges of the power canister with the opening in the system chassis, and then gently push the power canister into the chassis using the cam handle until it locks into place.
+
CAUTION: Do not use excessive force when sliding the power canister into the system; you can damage the connector.

. Close the cam handle so that the latch clicks into the locked position and the power canister is fully seated.
. Reconnect the power cord to the power canister, and secure the power cord to the power canister using the power cord retainer.
. Turn on the power to the new power canister.

== Step 4: Complete power canister replacement

Confirm that the new power canister is working correctly, gather support data, and resume normal operations.

.Steps

. On the new power canister, check that the green Power LED is on and the amber Attention LED is OFF.
