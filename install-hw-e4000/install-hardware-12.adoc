.Before you begin

Make sure you do the following:

* Register your hardware at http://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support^].
* Prepare a flat, static-free work area.
* Obtain an ESD wristband and take anti-static precautions.


.Steps

. Unpack the hardware contents, and then inventory the contained hardware against the packing slip.

. Install the rails.

CAUTION: When fully loaded with drives, each shelf weighs approximately 64 lb (20 kg). Two people or a mechanical lift are required to safely move the shelf.
+

.. Starting with the shelf you want at the bottom of the cabinet, place the back of the shelf (the end with the connectors) on the rails.
.. Supporting the shelf from the bottom, slide it into the cabinet.
