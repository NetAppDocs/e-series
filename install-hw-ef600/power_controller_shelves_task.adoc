. Connect the two power cables, one from each controller, to two separate power distribution units (PDUs) in the cabinet or rack.
+
IMPORTANT: Accessing a EF300 or EF600 controller canister from the shelf can be blocked by third-party PDUs. Do not use power outlets directly behind the controller canister.

. Allow the controller to boot for five minutes before completing the storage system set up and configuration.

The controller boots automatically. The LEDs flash on and the fans start to indicate that the controller is powering on.

NOTE: Fans are very loud when they first power on.
