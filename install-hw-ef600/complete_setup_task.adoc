[.lead]
Follow this procedure to connect the controller cables to your network, and then complete the setup and configuration.

== Cable the data hosts

[.lead]
Cable the storage system according to your network topology.

=== Direct-attach topology

[.lead]
The following example shows cabling to the data hosts using a direct-attach topology.

==== Example A: Direct-attach topology

|===
a|

. Connect each host adapter directly to the host ports on the controllers.

|===

=== Fabric topology

[.lead]
The following example shows cabling to the data hosts using a fabric topology.

==== Example B: Fabric topology

|===

. Connect each host adapter directly to the switch.
. Connect each switch directly to the host ports on the controllers.

== Connect and configure the management connection

[.lead]
You can configure the controller management ports using one of two options: using a DHCP server or using a static IP address.

=== Option 1: DHCP server

[.lead]
Follow this procedure to configure the management ports with a DHCP server.

===== Before you begin

* Your DHCP server is configured to associate an IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address as a permanent lease for each controller.
* You have obtained the assigned IP addresses you will use to connect to the storage system from your network administrator.

===== Steps

. Connect an Ethernet cable to each controller's management port, and connect the other end to your network.

. Open a browser and connect to the storage system using one of the controller IP addresses provided to you by your network administrator.

=== Option 2: Static IP address

[.lead]
Follow this procedure to configure the management ports manually by entering the IP address and the subnet mask.

===== Before you begin

* You have obtained the controllers`' IP address, subnet mask, gateway address, and DNS and NTP server information from your network administrator.
* You have ensured that the laptop you are using is not receiving network configuration from a DHCP server.

===== Steps

. Using an Ethernet cable, connect controller A's management port to the Ethernet port on a laptop.
+
NOTE: Controller A is the upper controller canister, and controller B is the lower controller canister.

. Open a browser and use the default IP address (169.254.128.101) to establish a connection to the controller. The controller sends back a self-signed certificate. The browser informs you that the connection is not secure.
. Follow the browser's instructions to proceed and launch SANtricity System Manager.
+
NOTE: If you are unable to establish a connection, verify that you are not receiving network configuration from a DHCP server.
+
. Set the storage system's password to login.
. Use the network settings provided by your network administrator in the *Configure Network Settings* wizard to configure controller A's network settings, and then select *Finish*.
+
NOTE: Because you reset the IP address, System Manager loses connection to the controller.
+
. Disconnect your laptop from the storage system, and connect the management port on controller A to your network.
. Open a browser on a computer connected to your network, and enter controller A's newly configured IP address.
+
IMPORTANT: If you lose the connection to controller A, you can connect an ethernet cable to controller B to reestablish connection to controller A through controller B (169.254.128.102).
+
. Log in using the password you set previously.
+
The Configure Network Settings wizard will appear.
+
. Use the network settings provided by your network administrator in the *Configure Network Settings* wizard to configure controller B's network settings, and then select *Finish*.
. Connect controller B to your network.
. Validate controller B's network settings by entering controller B's configured IP address in a browser.
+
IMPORTANT: If you lose the connection to controller B, you can use your previously validated connection to controller A to reestablish connection to controller B through controller A.

== After installing the hardware

[.lead]
After you have installed the EF300 or EF600 hardware, use the SANtricity software to configure and manage your storage system.

==== Before you begin

* You have configured your management ports and have verified and recorded your password and IP addresses.

==== Steps

. Connect your controller to a web browser.
. Use SANtricity System Manager to manage your EF300 or EF600 series storage system. Refer to the online help included with System Manager.

For accessing System Manager, use the same IP addresses that you used to configure your management ports.
