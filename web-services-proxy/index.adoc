== Find more information

* The proxy installation includes SANtricity Unified Manager, a web-based interface that provides configuration access to newer E-Series and EF-Series storage systems. For more information, see the Unified Manager online help, which is available from its user interface or from the https://docs.netapp.com/ess-11/topic/com.netapp.doc.ssm-uni-5/home.html?cp=5_1[Documentation Center^].
* GitHub contains a repository for the collection and organization of sample scripts illustrating the use of the NetApp SANtricity Web Services API. To access the repository, see: https://github.com/NetApp/webservices-samples[NetApp Webservices samples].
* Representational state transfer (REST) -- Web Services is a RESTful API that provides access to virtually all the SANtricity management capabilities, so you should be familiar with REST concepts. For more information, see http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm[Architectural Styles and
the Design of Network-based Software Architectures^].
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) -- Because data within Web Services is encoded through JSON, you should be familiar with JSON programming concepts. For more information, see http://www.json.org[Introducing JSON^].
