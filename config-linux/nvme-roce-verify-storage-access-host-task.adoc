Before using the namespace, verify that the host can write data to the namespace and read it back.

.Before you begin

Make sure you have the following:

* An initialized namespace that is formatted with a file system.

.Steps

. On the host, copy one or more files to the mount point of the disk.
. Copy the files back to a different folder on the original disk.
. Run the `diff` command to compare the copied files to the originals.

.After you finish

You remove the file and folder that you copied.
