You configure the switches according to the vendor's recommendations for NVMe over RoCE. These recommendations might include both configuration directives as well as code updates.

NOTE: *RISK OF DATA LOSS.* You must enable Priority Flow Control or Global Pause Control on the switch to eliminate the risk of data loss in an NVMe over RoCE environment.

Enable Ethernet pause frame flow control *end to end* as the best practice configuration.

Consult your network administrator for tips on selecting the best configuration for your environment.
