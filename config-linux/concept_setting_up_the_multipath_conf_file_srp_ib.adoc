The multipath.conf file is the configuration file for the multipath daemon, multipathd. The multipath.conf file overrides the built-in configuration table for multipathd. Any line in the file whose first non-white-space character is # is considered a comment line. Empty lines are ignored.

NOTE: For SANtricity operating system 8.30 and newer, NetApp recommends using the default settings as provided.

* For SLES, /usr/share/doc/packages/multipath-tools/multipath.conf.synthetic
* For RHEL, /usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9/multipath.conf
