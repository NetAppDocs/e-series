For the SAS protocol, you find the SAS addresses using the HBA utility, then use the HBA BIOS to make the appropriate configuration settings.

.Before you begin

Review guidelines for HBA utilities:

* Most HBA vendors offer an HBA utility. Depending on your host operating system and CPU, use either the LSI-sas2flash(6G) or sas3flash(12G) utility.
* Host I/O ports might automatically register if the host context agent is installed.

.Steps

. Download the HBA utility from your HBA vendor's web site.
. Install the utility.
. Use the HBA BIOS to select the appropriate settings for your configuration.
