You can configure the I/O directed to the device target based on which OS (and by extension multipathing method) you are using.

For RHEL 8, RHEL 9, and SLES 15, I/O is directed to the physical NVMe device targets by the Linux host. A native NVMe multipathing solution manages the physical paths underlying the single apparent physical device displayed by the host.

== Physical NVMe devices are I/O targets

It is best practice to run I/O to the links in `/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.[uuid#]` rather than directly to the physical nvme device path `/dev/nvme[subsys#]n[id#]`. The link between these two locations can be found using the following command:

----
# ls /dev/disk/by-id/ -l
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Oct 18 15:14 nvme-eui.0000320f5cad32cf00a0980000af4112 -> ../../nvme0n1
----

I/O run to `/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.[uuid#]` will be passed directly through `/dev/nvme[subsys#]n[id#]` which has all paths virtualized underneath it using the Native NVMe multipathing solution.

You can view your paths by running:

----
# nvme list-subsys
----

Example output:

----
nvme-subsys0 - NQN=nqn.1992-08.com.netapp:5700.600a098000a522500000000589aa8a6
\
+- nvme0 rdma traddr=192.4.21.131 trsvcid=4420 live
+- nvme1 rdma traddr=192.4.22.141 trsvcid=4420 live
----

If you specify a namespace device when using the `nvme list-subsys` command, it provides additional information about the paths to that namespace:

----
# nvme list-subsys /dev/nvme0n1
nvme-subsys0 - NQN=nqn.1992-08.com.netapp:5700.600a098000af44620000000058d5dd96
\
 +- nvme0 rdma traddr=192.168.130.101 trsvcid=4420 live non-optimized
 +- nvme1 rdma traddr=192.168.131.101 trsvcid=4420 live non-optimized
 +- nvme2 rdma traddr=192.168.130.102 trsvcid=4420 live optimized
 +- nvme3 rdma traddr=192.168.131.102 trsvcid=4420 live optimized
----

There are also hooks into the multipath commands to allow you to view your path information for native failover through them as well:

----
#multipath -ll
----

NOTE: To view the path information, the following must be set in /etc/multipath.conf:

----

defaults {
        enable_foreign nvme
}
----

Example output:

----
