You configure the switches according to the vendor's recommendations for iSCSI. These recommendations might include both configuration directives as well as code updates.

You must ensure the following:

* You have two separate networks for high availability. Make sure that you isolate your iSCSI traffic to separate network segments.
* You must enable flow control *end to end*.
* If appropriate, you have enabled jumbo frames.

NOTE: Port channels/LACP is not supported on the controller's switch ports. Host-side LACP is not recommended; multipathing provides the same benefits, and in some cases, better benefits.
