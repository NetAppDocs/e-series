The `multipath.conf` file is the configuration file for the multipath daemon, multipathd. The `multipath.conf` file overrides the built-in configuration table for multipathd. Any line in the file with a first non-white-space character of # is considered a comment line. Empty lines are ignored.

NOTE: For SANtricity operating system 8.30 and newer, NetApp recommends using the default settings as provided.

The `multipath.conf` files are available in the following locations:

* For SLES, `/usr/share/doc/packages/multipath-tools/multipath.conf.synthetic`
* For RHEL, `/usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9/multipath.conf`
