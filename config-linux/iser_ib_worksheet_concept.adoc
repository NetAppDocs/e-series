[.lead]
You can use this worksheet to record iSER over Infiniband storage configuration information. You need this information to perform provisioning tasks.

== iSER over InfiniBand: Host identifiers

NOTE: The software initiator IQN is determined during the task, xref:iser_ib_configure_network_attached_hosts_task.adoc[Configuring storage attached hosts with iSER networking].

Locate and document the initiator IQN from each host. For software initiators, the IQN is typically found in the /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi file.

== iSER over InfiniBand: Recommended configuration

Recommended configurations consist of two host (initiator) ports and four target ports.

== iSER over InfiniBand: Target IQN

Document the target IQN for the storage array. You will use this information in xref:iser_ib_configure_network_attached_hosts_task.adoc[Configuring storage attached hosts with iSER networking].

Find the Storage Array IQN name using SANtricity: *Storage Array* > *iSER* > *Manage Settings*. This information might be necessary when you create iSER sessions from operating systems that do not support send targets discovery.

== iSER over InfiniBand: Network configuration

Document the network configuration that will be used for the hosts and storage on the InfiniBand fabric. These instructions assume that two subnets will be used for full redundancy.

Your network administrator can provide the following information. You use this information in the topic, xref:iser_ib_configure_network_attached_hosts_task.adoc[Configuring storage attached hosts with iSER networking].

== Subnet A

Define the subnet to be used.
