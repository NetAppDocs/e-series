You install an FC HBA utility so you can view the worldwide port name (WWPN) of each host port. Additionally, you can use the HBA utility to change any settings recommended in the Notes column of the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool] for the supported configuration.

===== Before You Begin

Guidelines for HBA utilities:

 ** QLogic QConverge Console for QLogic HBAs
* Host I/O ports might automatically register if the host context agent is installed.

===== Steps
