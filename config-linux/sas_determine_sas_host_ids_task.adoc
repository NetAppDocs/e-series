For the SAS protocol, you find the SAS addresses using the HBA utility, then use the HBA BIOS to make the appropriate configuration settings.

Guidelines for HBA utilities:

* Most HBA vendors offer an HBA utility. Depending on your host operating system and CPU, use either the LSI-sas2flash(6G) or sas3flash(12G) utility.
* Host I/O ports might automatically register if the host context agent is installed.

. Download the HBA utility from your HBA vendor's web site.
. Install the utility.
. Use the HBA BIOS to select the appropriate settings for your configuration.
