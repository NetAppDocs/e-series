Before using the namespace, you verify that the host can write data to the namespace and read it back.

. On the host, copy one or more files to the mount point of the disk.
. Copy the files back to a different folder on the original disk.
. Run the diff command to compare the copied files to the originals.

You remove the file and folder that you copied.
