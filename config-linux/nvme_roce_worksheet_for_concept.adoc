You can use this worksheet to record NVMe over RoCE storage configuration information. You need this information to perform provisioning tasks.

== Direct connect topology

In a direct connect topology, one or more hosts are directly connected to the subsystem. In the SANtricity OS 11.50 release, we support a single connection from each host to a subsystem controller, as shown below. In this configuration, one HCA (host channel adapter) port from each host should be on the same subnet as the E-Series controller port it is connected to, but on a different subnet from the other HCA port.

An example configuration that satisfies the requirements consists of four network subnets as follows:

* Subnet 1: Host 1 HCA Port 1 and Controller 1 Host port 1
* Subnet 2: Host 1 HCA Port 2 and Controller 2 Host port 1
* Subnet 3: Host 2 HCA Port 1 and Controller 1 Host port 2
* Subnet 4: Host 2 HCA Port 2 and Controller 2 Host port 2

== Switch connect topology

In a fabric topology, one or more switches are used. Refer to https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool] for a list of supported switches.
