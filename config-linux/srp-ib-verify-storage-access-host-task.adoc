Before using the volume, you verify that the host can write data to the volume and read it back.

===== Before you begin

You must have initialized the volume and formatted it with a file system.

===== Steps

. On the host, copy one or more files to the mount point of the disk.
. Copy the files back to a different folder on the original disk.
. Run the diff command to compare the copied files to the originals.

===== After you finish

Remove the file and folder that you copied.
