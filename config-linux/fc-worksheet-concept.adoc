You can generate and print a PDF of this page, and then use the following worksheet to record FC storage configuration information. You need this information to perform provisioning tasks.

The illustration shows a host connected to an E-Series storage array in two zones. One zone is indicated by the blue line; the other zone is indicated by the red line. Any single port has two paths to the storage (one to each controller).
