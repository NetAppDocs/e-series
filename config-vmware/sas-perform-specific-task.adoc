For the SAS protocol, you determine host port addresses and make the recommended settings.

== Step 1: Determine SAS host identifiers--VMware

Find the SAS addresses using the HBA utility, and then use the HBA BIOS to make the appropriate configuration settings.

.About this task

Review the guidelines for HBA utilities:

* Most HBA vendors offer an HBA utility.

.Steps

. Download the HBA utility from your HBA vendor's web site.
. Install the utility.
. Use the HBA BIOS to select the appropriate settings for your configuration.
+
For appropriate settings, see the Notes column of the http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] for recommendations.

== Step 2: Record your configuration

You can generate and print a PDF of this page, and then use the following worksheet to record your protocol-specific storage configuration information. You need this information to perform provisioning tasks.
