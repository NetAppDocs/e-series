For the SAS protocol, you determine host port addresses and make the settings recommended in the Notes column of the http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)]

== Determine SAS host identifiers - VMware

[.lead]
For the SAS protocol, you find the SAS addresses using the HBA utility, then use the HBA BIOS to make the appropriate configuration settings.

Guidelines for HBA utilities:

* Most HBA vendors offer an HBA utility.
* Host I/O ports might automatically register if the host context agent is installed.

. Download the HBA utility from your HBA vendor's web site.
. Install the utility.
. Use the HBA BIOS to select the appropriate settings for your configuration.

See the Notes column of the http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool] for recommendations.

== Record SAS-specific information for VMware

[.lead]
Record your protocol-specific storage configuration information on the SAS worksheet. You need this information to perform provisioning tasks.

=== SAS worksheet - VMware
