Multipath software provides a redundant path to the storage array in case one of the physical paths is disrupted.

The multipath software presents the operating system with a single virtual device that represents the active physical paths to the storage. The multipath software also manages the failover process that updates the virtual device. For VMware, NVMe/FC uses High Performance Plugin (HPP).

Applicable only for FC, iSCSI, and SAS protocols, VMware provides plug-ins, known as Storage Array Type Plug-ins (SATP), to handle the failover implementations of specific vendors`' storage arrays. The SATP you should use is VMW_SATP_ALUA.
