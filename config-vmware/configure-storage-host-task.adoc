You can use the storage assigned to an ESXi host as either a Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) datastore or a raw device mapping (RDM). RDMs are not supported on the NVMe over Fibre Channel protocol.

All 6._x_ and 7 _x_ versions of ESXi support VMFS versions 5 and 6.


.Steps

. Make sure the volumes mapped to the ESXi host have been discovered properly.

. For instructions on creating VMFS datastores or using volumes as RDMs with either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client, see the https://docs.vmware.com/index.html[VMware Documentation web site^].
