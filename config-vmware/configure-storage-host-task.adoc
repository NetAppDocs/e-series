You can use the storage assigned to an ESXi host as either a Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) datastore or a raw device mapping (RDM). RDMs are not supported on the NVMe over Fibre Channel protocol.

All 6._x_ and 7 _x_ versions of ESXi support VMFS versions 5 and 6.

.Before you begin

The volumes mapped to the ESXi host must have been discovered properly.

.Steps

For instructions on creating VMFS datastores or using volumes as RDMs with  either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client, see https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/[VMware Documentation web site^].
