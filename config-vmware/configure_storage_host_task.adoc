You can use the storage assigned to an ESXi host as either a Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) datastore or a raw device mapping (RDM). RDMs are not supported on the NVMe over Fibre Channel protocol.

The volumes mapped to the ESXi host must have been discovered properly.

All 6._x_ and 7 _x_ versions of ESXi support VMFS versions 5 and 6.

* For instructions on creating VMFS datastores using either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client, see the VMware pubs webpage (https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/) for documentation on this topic.
* For instructions on using volumes as RDMs using either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client, see the VMware pubs webpage (https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/) for documentation on this topic.
