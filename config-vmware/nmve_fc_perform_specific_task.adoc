For the NVME over Fibre Channel protocol, you configure the switches and determine the host port identifiers.

== Configure the NVMe/FC switches

[.lead]
Configuring (zoning) the NVMe over Fibre Channel (FC) switches enables the hosts to connect to the storage array and limits the number of paths. You zone the switches using the management interface for the switches.

* You must have administrator credentials for the switches.
* You must have used your HBA utility to discover the WWPN of each host initiator port and of each controller target port connected to the switch.

NOTE: A vendor's HBA utility can be used to upgrade and obtain specific information about the HBA. Refer to the support section of the vendor's website for instructions on how to obtain the HBA utility.

For details about zoning your switches, see the switch vendor's documentation.

Each initiator port must be in a separate zone with all of its corresponding target ports.

. Log in to the FC switch administration program, and then select the zoning configuration option.
. Create a new zone that includes the first host initiator port and that also includes all of the target ports that connect to the same FC switch as the initiator.
. Create additional zones for each FC host initiator port in the switch.
. Save the zones, and then activate the new zoning configuration.

== Determine the host ports WWPNs - NVMe/FC VMware

[.lead]
To configure FC zoning, you must determine the worldwide port name (WWPN) of each initiator port.

. Connect to the ESXi host using SSH or the ESXi shell.
. Run the following command:
+
----
esxcfg**-**scsidevs â€“a
----

. Record the initiator identifiers. The output will be similar to this example:
+
----
vmhba3 lpfc link-up  fc.20000090fa05e848:10000090fa05e848 (0000:03:00.0)

vmhba4 lpfc link-up  fc.20000090fa05e849:10000090fa05e849 (0000:03:00.1)
Emulex Corporation Emulex LPe16000 16Gb PCIe Fibre Channel Adapter
----

== Enable HBA Driver

[.lead]
Support for NVMe must be enabled within Broadcom/Emulex and Marvell/Qlogic HBA drivers.

. Execute the following command from the ESXi shell:
 ** *Broadcom/Emulex HBA Driver*
+
----
esxcli system module parameters set -m lpfc -p "lpfc_enable_fc4_type=3"
----

 ** *Marvell/Qlogic HBA Driver*
+
----
esxcfg-module -s "ql2xnvmesupport=1" qlnativefc
----
. Reboot the host.

== NVMe/FC worksheet for VMware

[.lead]
You can use this worksheet to record NVMe over Fibre Channel storage configuration information. You need this information to perform provisioning tasks.

The illustration shows a host connected to an E-Series storage array in two zones. One zone is indicated by the blue line; the other zone is indicated by the red line. Each zone contains one initiator port and all target ports.
