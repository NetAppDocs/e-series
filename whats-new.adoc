____
The following table describes new features in SANt^3^ricity OS.

*New features in Version 11.71*

*Note:* The Resource Provisioning capability, which is available only on
EF300 and EF600 systems with specific NVMe SSDs, has been disabled in
this release so that outstanding issues can be resolved. Note that in
some System Manager views, components might be reported as
resource-provisioning (or DULBE) capable, but the ability to create
resource- provisioned volumes is not available.
____

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|New feature |Description
|EF300 expansion |This release provides support for expansion to SAS-3
enclosures for the EF300 storage system. With this expansion, the
4KiB-block NVMe SSDs can coexist with 512e SAS SSDs and HDDs. However,
drives with different block sizes cannot be configured in the same pool
or volume group.

|FEC mode option in iSCSI configuration |For storage arrays using the
25Gb iSCSI host interface card, a new option is available for setting
the Forward Error Correction (FEC) mode when you configure iSCSI ports.

|Remote Storage Volumes |The optional Remote Storage Volumes feature
allows you to import volumes from a remote storage system to a local E-
Series storage system using an iSCSI connection. The remote storage may
be the same brand as your E-Series system or from a different storage
vendor, as long as it is accessible via iSCSI.

|New feature |Description
|Sanitize (erase) capability added for non-FDE drives |The drive
sanitize feature now includes non-FDE drives in the procedure. From the
Hardware page, you can open the Drive's context menu and select "Erase"
(previously, this selection was "Secure Erase").

|Secure connection for email alerts |To enable encrypted email
notifications, you can optionally configure outgoing emails (alerts,
ASUP dispatches) to supply authentication credentials. Encryption types
include SMTPS and STARTTLS.

|AutoSupport additions |An alert now appears in the Notifications area
when AutoSupport is not enabled.

|Syslog alert format change |The Syslog alert format now supports RFC
5424.

*New features in Version 11.70*
____

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|New feature |Description
|New storage system model – EF300 |This release introduces the EF300
low-cost all-NVMe-flash storage system. The EF300 includes 24 NVME SSD
drives and a single host interface card (HIC) per controller. The
supported NVMe over Fabrics host interfaces include NVMe over IB, NVMe
over RoCE, and NVMe over FC. The supported SCSI interfaces include FC,
IB over iSER, and IB over SRP. Multiple EF300 storage systems and other
E- Series storage systems can be viewed and managed in Unified Manager.

|New Resource Provisioning feature (EF300 and EF600 only) |The Resource
Provisioning feature is new for the EF300 and EF600 storage systems.
Resource-provisioned volumes can be put in use immediately with no
background initialization process.
|===

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|New feature |Description
|Add 512e block size option (EF300 and EF600 only) |For EF300 and EF600
storage systems, a volume can be set to support a 512-byte or a 4KiB
block size. The 512e capability has been added to allow support of the
iSCSI host interface and the VMware OS. If possible, System Manager
suggests the appropriate default value.

|New option for sending AutoSupport dispatches on demand |A new Send
AutoSupport Dispatch feature allows you to send data to technical
support without waiting for a scheduled dispatch. This option is
available in the AutoSupport tab of the Support Center.

|External Key Management Server enhancements a|
The feature for connecting to an external key management server includes
the following enhancements:

____
Bypass the function for creating a backup key.

Choose an intermediate certificate for the key management server, in addition to the client and server certificates.
____

|Certificate enhancements |This release allows for using an external
tool such as OpenSSL to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR),
which also requires you to import a private key file along with the
signed certificate.

|New Offline Initialization feature for Volume Groups |For volume
creation, System Manager provides a method for skipping the host
assignment step so that newly created volumes are initialized offline.
This capability is applicable only to RAID volume groups on SAS drives (
i.e., not to dynamic disk pools or to the NVMe SSDs included in the
EF300 and EF600 storage systems). This feature is for workloads that
need to have the volumes at full performance when usage begins, rather
than having initialization run in the background.
|===

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|New feature |Description
|New Collect Configuration Data feature |This new feature saves RAID
configuration data from the controller, which includes all data for
volume groups and disk pools (the same information as the CLI command
for save storageArray dbmDatabase). This capability has been added to
aid technical support and is located in the Diagnostics tab of the
Support Center.

|Change default preservation capacity for disk pools in 12 drive case
|Previously, a 12-drive disk pool was created with enough preservation
(spare) capacity to cover two drives. The default is now changed to
handle a single drive failure to offer a more cost-effective small pool
default.

*New features in Version 11.62*
____

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|New feature |Description
|Downloadable CLI |System Manager for the E5700, EF570, E2800, and EF280
arrays now includes the ability to download and install the SANtricity
command line interface (CLI) via a link in the *Settings* > *System* >
*Add-ons* page. This is the https-based version of the CLI (also
referred to as "Secure CLI"). This capability was previously released
with the EF600 array.

|Mirroring configuration changes in System Manager and Unified Manager
|The tasks for configuring synchronous and asynchronous mirrored pairs
have moved from System Manager to Unified Manager. All other tasks for
managing mirrored pairs remain in System Manager.

|New 200Gb-capable HIC (EF600 arrays only) |This release adds a new
200Gb-capable HIC for EF600 storage arrays. Interfaces supported are
NVMe/IB, NVMe/RoCE, and iSER/IB. Additionally, 100Gb SRP/IB is
supported.

a|
Additional options on 100Gb HIC (EF600

arrays only)

|On the existing 100Gb HIC, iSER/IB and SRP/IB interfaces are now
supported for EF600 storage arrays. (These interfaces are already
supported for EF570 and E5700 arrays.)

|Delete mail server in System Manager |System Manager allowed a mail
server to be configured, but did not have an easy mechanism to remove
it. With this release, the mail server configuration in System Manager
can now be removed from Alerts, so that alerts are no longer sent to the
email addresses associated with this mail server.

|Optimization capacity adjustments for pools and volume groups (SSD
drives only) in System Manager |For SSD drives, a new optimization
capacity slider is available in System Manager for the Pool settings and
Volume Group settings. The slider enables you to adjust the balance of
available capacity versus SSD write performance and drive wear life.

|New host types in System Manager |When you create new hosts in System
Manager, the presented host options are now organized into three
categories to provide better guidance: Common, Uncommon, and Use only if
directed.
