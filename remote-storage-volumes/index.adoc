Use the SANtricityÂ® Remote Storage Volumes feature to import data from a remote storage device directly to a local E-Series volume.
This feature helps streamline the process for equipment upgrades and provides data migration capabilities to move data from non-E-Series devices to E-Series systems.

== Configuration overview

The Remote Storage Volumes feature is available with SANtricity System Manager on selected submodel IDs. To use this feature, you must configure a remote storage system and an E-Series storage system to communicate with each other.

Use the following workflow:
