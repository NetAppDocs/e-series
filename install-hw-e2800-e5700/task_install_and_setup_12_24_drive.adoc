You cable the controllers to your network to complete storage system setup and configuration.

=== Cable the data hosts

[.lead]
Cable the system according to your network topology.

NOTE: If you are using AIXÂ®, you must install the E-Series multipath driver on the host before connecting it to the array.

==== Direct Attach Topology

[.lead]
The following example shows cabling the data hosts using a direct-attach topology.

===== Example A: Direct-attach topology

=== Connect and configure the management connection

[.lead]
You can configure you controller management ports with a DHCP server, or using static IP addresses.

Make sure you have obtained the network configuration information from your network administrator for the controllers (IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS and NTP server information).

==== Option 1: Management port configuration with DHCP

[.lead]
You can configure the management ports with a DHCP server.

* Your DHCP server is configured to associate an IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address as a permanent lease for each controller.
* You have obtained the assigned IP addresses you will use to connect to the storage system from your network administrator.

. Connect an Ethernet cable to each controller's management port, and connect the other end to your network.

+
|===

. Open a browser and connect to the storage system using one of the controller IP addresses provided to you by your network administrator.

==== Option 2: Management port configuration with static IP addresses

[.lead]
You configure the management ports manually by entering the IP address and the subnet mask.

* You have obtained the controllers`' IP address, subnet mask, gateway address, and DNS and NTP server information from your network administrator.
* You have ensured that the laptop you are using is not receiving network configuration from a DHCP server.

. Using an Ethernet cable, connect controller A's management port to the Ethernet port on a laptop.

. Open a browser and use the default IP address (169.254.128.101) to establish a connection to the controller. The controller sends back a self-signed certificate. The browser informs you that the connection is not secure.
. Follow the browser's instructions to proceed and launch SANtricity System Manager.
+
NOTE: If you are unable to establish a connection, verify that you are not receiving network configuration from a DHCP server.

. Set the storage system's password to login.
. Use the network settings provided by your network administrator in the *Configure Network Settings* wizard to configure controller A's network settings, and then select Finish.
+
NOTE: Because you reset the IP address, System Manager loses connection to the controller.

. Disconnect your laptop from the storage system, and connect the management port on controller A to your network.
. Open a browser on a computer connected to your network, and enter controller A's newly configured IP address.
+
IMPORTANT: If you lose the connection to controller A, you can connect an ethernet cable to controller B to reestablish connection to controller A through controller B (169.254.128.102).

. Log in using the password you set previously.
+
The Configure Network Settings wizard will appear.

. Use the network settings provided by your network administrator in the *Configure Network Settings* wizard to configure controller B's network settings, and then select Finish.
. Connect controller B to your network.
. Validate controller B's network settings by entering controller B's newly configured IP address in a browser.
+
IMPORTANT: If you lose the connection to controller B, you can use your previously validated connection to controller A to reestablish connection to controller B through controller A.

=== After installing the hardware

[.lead]
After you have installed your hardware, use the SANtricity software to configure and manage your storage system.

* You have configured your management ports and have verified and recorded your password and IP addresses.

. Use the SANtricity software to configure and manage your storage arrays.
. In the simplest network configuration, connect your controller to a web browser and use SANtricity System Manager for managing a single E2800 or E5700 series storage array.
