[.lead]
Before you replace an E5700 controller or add a second controller, review the requirements and considerations.

Each controller canister contains a controller card, a battery, and an optional host interface card (HIC).

== Procedure overview

When you replace a failed controller canister, you must remove the battery and HIC, if one is installed, from the original controller canister, and install them in the replacement controller canister.

For a controller shelf with two controllers (duplex configuration), you can replace a controller canister while your storage array is powered on and performing host I/O operations, as long as the following conditions are true:

* The second controller canister in the shelf has Optimal status.
* The *OK to remove* field in the Details area of the Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager displays *Yes*, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.

You can determine if you have a failed controller canister in two ways:

* The Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager directs you to replace the controller canister.
* The amber Attention LED on the controller canister is on, indicating that the controller has a fault.

NOTE: The figure shows an example controller canister; the host ports on your controller canister might be different.

== Requirements for replacing a failed controller

* You must have a replacement controller canister with the same part number as the controller canister you are replacing.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* You must use labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* You must have a #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* You must have installed SANtricity Storage Manager on a management station, so you can use the storage array's command line interface (CLI).
