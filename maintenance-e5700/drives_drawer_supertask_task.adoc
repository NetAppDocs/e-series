= Replace drive drawer (60-drive)
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
The steps to replace a failed drive drawer in an E5760 controller shelf or a DE460C drive shelf depend on whether the volumes in the drawer are protected by Drawer Loss Protection. If all volumes in the drive drawer are in disk pools or volume groups that have Drawer Loss Protection, you can perform this procedure online. Otherwise, you must stop all host I/O activity and power off the shelf before replacing the drive drawer.

== Prepare to replace drive drawer (60-drive)

[.lead]
You prepare to replace a drive drawer by determining if you can perform the replacement procedure while the drive shelf is online or if you need to stop host I/O activity and power off any of the shelves that are powered on. If you are replacing a drawer in a shelf with Drawer Loss Protection, there is no need to stop host I/O activity and power off any of the shelves.

* You must have installed SANtricity Storage Manager on a management station, so you can use the storage array's command line interface (CLI).
* Make sure the drive shelf meets all of these conditions:
 ** The drive shelf cannot be over temperature.
 ** Both fans must be installed and have a status of Optimal.
 ** All drive shelf components must be in place.
 ** The volumes in the drive drawer cannot be in a Degraded state.
+
IMPORTANT: *Possible loss of data access --* If a volume is already in a Degraded state, and you remove drives from the drive drawer, the volume can fail.

. Determine if the drive shelf is powered on.
 ** If the power is off, you do not need to issue the CLI command. Go to link:drives_drawer_supertask_task.md#[Remove cable chains].
 ** If the power is on, go to the next step.
. Type the following command on the command line, and press *Enter*:
+
----
SMcli <ctlr_IP1\> -p "array_password" -c "set tray [trayID] drawer [drawerID]
serviceAllowedIndicator=on;"
----
+
where:

 ** <ctlr_IP1> is the identifier of the controller.
 ** array_password is the password for the storage array. You must enclose the value for array_password in double quotation marks ("").
 ** [trayID] is the identifier of the drive shelf that contains the drive drawer that you want to replace. Drive shelf ID values are 0 to 99. You must enclose the value for trayIDin square brackets.
 ** [drawerID] is the identifier of the drive drawer that you want to replace. Drawer ID values are 1 (top drawer) to 5 (bottom drawer). You must enclose the value for drawerIDin square brackets.
This command ensures you can remove the top-most drawer in drive shelf 10:

+
----
SMcli <ctlr_IP1\> -p "safety-1" -c "set tray [10] drawer [1]
serviceAllowedIndicator=forceOnWarning;"
----

. Determine if you need to stop host I/O activity, as follows:
 ** If the command succeeds, you do not need to stop host I/O activity. All drives in the drawer are in pools or volume groups with Drawer Loss Protection. Go to link:drives_drawer_supertask_task.md#[Remove cable chains].
+
IMPORTANT: *Possible damage to drives* -- Wait 30 seconds after the command completes before you open the drive drawer. Waiting 30 seconds allows the drives to spin down, which prevents possible damage to the hardware.

 ** If a warning is displayed indicating that this command could not be completed, you must stop host I/O activity before removing the drawer. The warning is displayed because one or more drives in the affected drawer are in pools or volume groups without Drawer Loss Protection. To avoid losing data, you must complete the next steps to stop host I/O activity and to power off the drive shelf and the controller shelf.
. Ensure that no I/O operations are occurring between the storage array and all connected hosts. For example, you can perform these steps:
 ** Stop all processes that involve the LUNs mapped from the storage to the hosts.
 ** Ensure that no applications are writing data to any LUNs mapped from the storage to the hosts.
 ** Unmount all file systems associated with volumes on the array.
*Note:* The exact steps to stop host I/O operations depend on the host operating system and the configuration, which are beyond the scope of these instructions. If you are not sure how to stop host I/O operations in your environment, consider shutting down the host.
. If the storage array participates in a mirroring relationship, stop all host I/O operations on the secondary storage array.
+
IMPORTANT: *Possible data loss* -- If you continue this procedure while I/O operations are occurring, the host application might lose data because the storage array will not be accessible.

. Wait for any data in cache memory to be written to the drives.
+
The green Cache Active LED on the back of each controller is on when cached data needs to be written to the drives. You must wait for this LED to turn off.
+

+
image:../media/legend_icon_01_maint-e5700.gif[] Cache Active LED

. From the Home page of SANtricity System Manager, select *View Operations in Progress*.
. Wait for all operations to complete before continuing with the next step.
. Power off the shelves as follows:
+
If you are replacing a drawer in a shelf *with* Drawer Loss Protection:
+
There is NO need to power off any of the shelves.
+
You can perform the replace procedure while the drive drawer is online, because the Set Drawer Service Action Allowed Indicator CLI command completed successfully.
+
If you are replacing a drawer in a _controller_ shelf *without* Drawer Loss Protection:

 .. Turn off both power switches on the controller shelf.
Wait for all LEDs on the controller shelf to go dark.

+
If you are replacing a drawer in an _expansion_ drive shelf *without* Drawer Loss Protection:

 .. Turn off both power switches on the controller shelf.
 .. Wait for all LEDs on the controller shelf to go dark.
 .. Turn off both power switches on the drive shelf.
Wait two minutes for drive activity to stop.

Go to link:drives_drawer_supertask_task.md#[Remove cable chains].

== Remove cable chains

[.lead]
You remove both cable chains so you can remove and replace a failed drive drawer. The left and right cable chains allow the drawers to slide in and out.

* You have issued the Set Drawer Attention Indicator CLI command, or you have stopped host I/O activity and powered off the drive shelf and controller shelf.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* You have a flashlight.

Each drive drawer has left and right cable chains. The metal ends on the cable chains slide into corresponding vertical and horizontal guide rails inside the enclosure, as follows:

* The left and right vertical guide rails connect the cable chain to the enclosure's midplane.
* The left and right horizontal guide rails connect the cable chain to the individual drawer.

IMPORTANT: *Possible hardware damage --* If the drive tray is powered on, the cable chain is energized until both ends are unplugged. To avoid shorting out the equipment, do not allow the unplugged cable chain connector to touch the metal chassis if the other end of the cable chain is still plugged in.

. From the rear of the drive shelf, remove the right fan canister:
 .. Press the orange tab to release the fan canister handle.
+
The figure shows the handle for the fan canister extended and released from the orange tab on the left.

+
image:../media/legend_icon_01_maint-e5700.gif[] Fan canister handle

 .. Using the handle, pull the fan canister out of the drive tray, and set it aside.
 .. If the tray is powered on, ensure that the left fan goes to its maximum speed.
+
IMPORTANT: *Possible equipment damage due to overheating* -- If the tray is powered on, do not remove both fans at the same time. Otherwise, the equipment might overheat.
. Determine which cable chain to disconnect:
 ** If the power is on, the amber Attention LED on the front of the drawer indicates the cable chain you need to disconnect.
 ** If the power is off, you must manually determine which of the five cable chains to disconnect.
The figure shows the right side of the drive shelf with the fan canister removed. With the fan canister removed, you can see the five cable chains and the vertical and horizontal connectors for each drawer.
