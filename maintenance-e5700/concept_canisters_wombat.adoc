Canisters consist of three different types: power-fan canisters (power supplies) that supply a redundant power source and adequate cooling in a 12-drive or 24-drive controller shelf or drive shelf; power canisters that are used for power redundancy in a 60-drive controller shelf or drive shelf; and fan canisters that are used for cooling the 60-drive controller shelf or drive shelf.
