For the SAS protocol, you determine host port addresses and make the settings recommended in the Notes column of the http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)].

== Step 1: Determine SAS host identifiers--Windows

For the SAS protocol, you find the SAS addresses using the HBA utility, then use the HBA BIOS to make the appropriate configuration settings.

.Before you begin

Review the guidelines for HBA utilities:

* Most HBA vendors offer an HBA utility. Depending on your host operating system and CPU, use either the LSI-sas2flash(6G) or sas3flash(12G) utility.
* Host I/O ports might automatically register if the host context agent is installed.

.Steps

. Download the LSI-sas2flash(6G) or sas3flash(12G) utility from your HBA vendor's web site.
. Install the utility.
. Use the HBA BIOS to select the appropriate settings for your configuration.

See the Notes column of the http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] for recommendations.

== Step 2: Record your configuration

You can generate and print a PDF of this page, and then use the following worksheet to record your protocol-specific storage configuration information. You need this information to perform provisioning tasks.
