[.lead]
FDE/FIPS security refers to secure-capable drives that encrypt data during writes and decrypt data during reads using a unique encryption key. These secure-capable drives prevent unauthorized

access to the data on a drive that is physically removed from the storage array. Secure-capable drives can be either Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives. FIPS drives have undergone certification testing.

[NOTE]
For volumes that require FIPS support, use only FIPS drives. Mixing FIPS and FDE drives in a volume group or pool will result in all drives being treated as FDE drives. Also, an FDE drive cannot be added to or used as a spare in an all-FIPS volume group or pool.
