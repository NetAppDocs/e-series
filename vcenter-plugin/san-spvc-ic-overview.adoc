[.lead]
The SANtricity Storage Plugin for vCenter provides integrated management of E-Series storage arrays from within a VMware vSphere Client session.

== Available tasks

You can use the plugin to perform the following tasks:

* View and manage discovered storage arrays in the network.
* Perform batch operations on groups of multiple storage arrays.
* Perform upgrades on the software OS.
* Import settings from one storage array to another.
* Configure volumes, SSD cache, hosts, host clusters, pools, and volume groups.
* Launch the System Manager interface for additional management tasks on an array.


[NOTE]
The plugin is not a direct replacement for the System Manager interface, which is embedded on each controller for a storage array. System Manager provides additional management features; if desired, you can open System Manager by selecting a storage array in the main view of the plugin and then clicking *Launch*.

The plugin requires a VMware vCenter Server Appliance deployed in the VMware environment and an application host to install and run the plugin webserver.


Refer to the following figure for more information on communications in the vCenter environment.
