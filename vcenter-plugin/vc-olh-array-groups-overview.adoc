You can manage your physical and virtualized infrastructure by grouping a set of storage arrays. You might want to group storage arrays to make it easier to run monitoring or reporting jobs.

Types of storage array groups:

* *All group.* The All group is the default group and includes all the storage arrays discovered in your organization. The All group can be accessed from the main view.
* *User-created group.* A user-created group includes the storage arrays that you manually select to add to that group. User-created groups can be accessed from the main view.
