When you implement the Drive Security feature, you can use an internal security key or an external security key to lock down data when a secure-enabled drive is removed from the storage array.

A security key is a string of characters, which is shared between the secure-enabled drives and controllers in a storage array. Internal keys are maintained on the controller's persistent memory. External keys are maintained on a separate key management server, using a Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).
