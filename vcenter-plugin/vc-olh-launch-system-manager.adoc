To access System Manager, you must have an out-of-band connection to a network management client with a web browser.

.Steps

. From the *Manage* page, select one or more storage arrays that you want to manage.
. Click *Launch*.
+
The system opens a new tab in the browser, and then displays the System Manager login page.

. Enter your username and password, and then click *Log in*.
