You need to remove the controller canister from the controller shelf, so you can remove the battery.

When you remove a controller canister, you must disconnect all cables. Then, you can slide the controller canister out of the controller shelf.

.Before you begin

Make sure you have the following:

* An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* Labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.

.Steps

. Put on an ESD wristband or take other antistatic precautions.
. Label each cable that is attached to the controller canister.
. Disconnect all the cables from the controller canister.
+
CAUTION: To prevent degraded performance, do not twist, fold, pinch, or step on the cables.

. If the host ports on the controller canister use SFP+ transceivers, leave them installed.
. Confirm that the Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is off.
. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, and then open the cam handle to the right to release the controller canister from the shelf.

. Using two hands and the cam handle, slide the controller canister out of the shelf.

CAUTION: Always use two hands to support the weight of a controller canister.

If you are removing the controller canister from an E2812 controller shelf, E2824 controller shelf or EF280 flash array, a flap swings into place to block the empty bay, helping to maintain air flow and cooling.

. Turn the controller canister over, so that the removable cover faces up.
. Place the controller canister on a flat, static-free surface.
