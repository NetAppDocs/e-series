[.lead]
You add a second controller to a controller shelf that has only one controller canister. You can add a second controller canister to the simplex version of either a E2812 controller shelf, E2824 controller shelf, or EF280 flash array.

This procedure is also referred to as a simplex-to-duplex conversion. This is an online procedure. You can access data on the storage array while you perform this procedure.

== Step 1: Verify the new controller's part number

[.lead]
You confirm that the new controller has the same part number as the currently installed controller.

===== Steps

. Unpack the new controller canister, and set it on a flat, static-free surface.
. Locate the MAC address and FRU part number labels on the back of the controller canister.
+
image::../media/28_dwg_e2800_labels_maint-e2800.gif[]
+
image:../media/legend_icon_01_maint-e2800.gif[] MAC address: The MAC address for management port 1 ("`P1`"). If you used DHCP to obtain the original controller's IP address, you will need this address to connect to the new controller.
+
image:../media/legend_icon_02_maint-e2800.gif[] FRU part number: This number must match the replacement part number for the currently installed controller.

. From SANtricity System Manager, locate the replacement part number for the installed controller canister.
 .. Select *Hardware*.
 .. Locate the controller shelf, which is marked with the controller icon image:../media/sam1130_ss_hardware_controller_icon_maint-e2800.gif[].
 .. Click the controller icon.
 .. Select the controller, and click *Next*.
 .. On the *Base* tab, make a note of the *Replacement Part Number* for the controller.
. Confirm that the replacement part number for the installed controller is the same as the FRU part number for the new controller.
+
IMPORTANT: *Possible loss of data access* -- If the two part numbers are not the same, do not attempt this procedure. In addition, if the original controller canister includes a host interface card (HIC), you must install an identical HIC into the new controller canister. The presence of mismatched controllers or HICs will cause the new controller to lock down when you bring it online.

== Step 2: Install host interface card

[.lead]
You install the same model of host interface card (HIC) in the second controller canister, if the currently installed controller includes a HIC.

===== Before you begin

* If the currently installed controller canister includes a HIC, you have a new HIC that is identical to the HIC in the currently installed controller canister.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* You have a #1 Phillips screwdriver.

===== Steps

. Unpack the new HIC, and confirm it is identical to the existing HIC.
+
IMPORTANT: *Possible loss of data access* -- The HICs installed in the two controller canisters must be identical. If the replacement HIC is not identical to the HIC you are replacing, do not attempt this procedure. The presence of mismatched HICs will cause the new controller to lock down when it comes online.

. Turn the new controller canister over, so that the cover faces up.
. Press the button on the cover, and slide the cover off.
. Using a #1 Phillips screwdriver, remove the four screws that attach the blank faceplate to the controller canister, and remove the faceplate.
. Align the three thumbscrews on the HIC with the corresponding holes on the controller, and align the connector on the bottom of the HIC with the HIC interface connector on the controller card.
+
Be careful not to scratch or bump the components on the bottom of the HIC or on the top of the controller card.

. Carefully lower the HIC into place, and seat the HIC connector by pressing gently on the HIC.
+
IMPORTANT: **Possible equipment damage** -- Be very careful not to pinch the gold ribbon connector for the controller LEDs between the HIC and the thumbscrews.
+

+
image:../media/legend_icon_01_maint-e2800.gif[] Host interface card (HIC) image:../media/legend_icon_02_maint-e2800.gif[] Thumbscrews

. Hand-tighten the HIC thumbscrews.
+
Do not use a screwdriver, or you might over tighten the screws.

. Using a #1 Phillips screwdriver, attach the new HIC faceplate to the controller canister with the four screws you removed previously.
+
image::../media/28_dwg_e2800_hic_faceplace_screws_maint-e2800.gif[]

. Reinstall the cover on the controller canister by sliding the cover from back to front until the button clicks.
. Set the controller canister aside until you are ready to install it.

== Step 3: Collect support data

[.lead]
You collect support data before and after replacing a component to ensure you can send a full set of logs to technical support in case the replacement does not resolve the problem.

===== Before you begin

* You have installed SANtricity Storage Manager on a management station, so you can use the storage array's command line interface (CLI).
+
If SANtricity Storage Manager has not yet been installed, follow the instructions in the link:../config-linux/index.html[Linux express configuration], link:../config-windows/index.html[Windows express configuration], or link:../config-vmware/index.html[VMware express configuration] to download and install the software.

===== Steps

. From the Home page of SANtricity System Manager, ensure that the storage array has Optimal status.
+
If the status is not Optimal, use the Recovery Guru or contact technical support to resolve the problem. Do not continue with this procedure.

. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
 .. Select *Support* > *Support Center* > *Diagnostics*.
 .. Select *Collect Support Data*.
 .. Click *Collect*.
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name support-data.7z.
. Ensure that no I/O operations are occurring between the storage array and all connected hosts. For example, you can perform these steps:
 ** Stop all processes that involve the LUNs mapped from the storage to the hosts.
 ** Ensure that no applications are writing data to any LUNs mapped from the storage to the hosts.
 ** Unmount all file systems associated with volumes on the array.
*Note:* The exact steps to stop host I/O operations depend on the host operating system and the configuration, which are beyond the scope of these instructions. If you are not sure how to stop host I/O operations in your environment, consider shutting down the host.

+
IMPORTANT: *Possible data loss* -- If you continue this procedure while I/O operations are occurring, you might lose data.

== Step 4: Change configuration to duplex

[.lead]
Before adding a second controller to the controller shelf, you must change the configuration to duplex by installing a new NVSRAM file and using the command line interface to set the storage array to duplex. You change the configuration to duplex by installing a new NVSRAM file. The duplex version of the NVSRAM file is included with the download file for SANtricity OS Software (controller firmware).

===== Before you begin

* You have installed SANtricity Storage Manager on a management station, so you can use the storage array's command line interface (CLI).

===== Steps

. Download the latest SANtricity OS software files from the NetApp Support Site to your management client.
 .. From SANtricity System Manager, select *Support* > *Upgrade Center*.
 .. In the area labeled "`SANtricity OS Software upgrade,`" click *NetApp Support*.
 .. On the NetApp Support Site, click the *Downloads* tab, and then select *Software*.
 .. Locate *E-Series/EF-Series SANtricity OS (Controller Firmware)*.
 .. For the platform, select *E2800*, and click *Go!*
 .. Select the version of SANtricity OS (Controller Firmware) you want to install, and click *View & Download*.
 .. Follow the online instructions to complete the file download.
+
SANtricity OS software files have filenames similar to E29xx_1150 with a .zip or .tar.gz extension. The packaged file includes three files.

  *** SANtricity OS software (controller firmware)
+
Example file name: RCB_11.50_290x.dlp

  *** Controller NVSRAM -- duplex
+
Example file name: N290X-830834-*D01*.dlp

  *** Controller NVSRAM -- simplex
+
Example file name: N290X-830834-*S01*.dlp
. Upgrade the files using either SANtricity System Manager or the Enterprise Management Window's (EMW) script editor.
+
IMPORTANT: *Risk of data loss or risk of damage to the storage array* -- Do not make changes to the storage array while the upgrade is occurring. Maintain power to the storage array.
+
You can cancel the operation during the pre-upgrade health check, but not during transferring or activating.

 ** To use SANtricity System Manager:
  ... Under SANtricity OS Software upgrade, click *Begin Upgrade*.
  ... Click *Browse*, and select the SANtricity OS software file.
  ... Select the checkbox labeled *Transfer Controller NVSRAM file with upgrade*.
  ... Click *Browse*, and select the duplex version of the Controller NVSRAM file (the file with "`D`" near the end of its name).
  ... Click *Start*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
The upgrade begins and the following occurs: (1) The pre-upgrade health check begins. If the pre-upgrade health check fails, use the Recovery Guru or contact technical support to resolve the problem. (2) The controller files are transferred and activated. The time required depends on your storage array configuration. (3) The controller reboots automatically to apply the new settings.
 ** To use script editor in the Enterprise Management Window (EMW):
  ... Open the EMW in SANtricity Storage Manager on your local host.
  ... Select the storage array.
  ... Select *Tools* > *Execute Script*.
  ... Type the following command in the text box.
+
----
download storageArray NVSRAM file="filename" healthCheckMelOverride=FALSE;
----
+
In this command, filename is the file path and the file name for duplex version of the Controller NVSRAM file (the file with "`D`" in its name). Enclose the file path and the file name in double quotation marks (" "). For example:
+
----
file="C:\downloads\N290X-830834-D01.dlp"
----

  ... Select *Tools* > *Verify and Execute*.
The upgrade begins and the following occurs: (1) The pre-upgrade health check begins. If the pre-upgrade health check fails, use the Recovery Guru or contact technical support to resolve the problem. (2) The controller files are transferred and activated. The time required depends on your storage array configuration. (3) The controller reboots automatically to apply the new settings.

. (Optional) To see a list of what was upgraded, click *Save Log*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name `latest-upgrade-log-timestamp.txt`.

. Do the following:
 ** Verify that all components appear on the Hardware page.
 ** Verify the new software and firmware versions by checking the Software and Firmware Inventory dialog box (go to *Support* > *Upgrade Center*, and then click the link for *Software and Firmware Inventory*).
 ** If you upgraded controller NVSRAM, any custom settings that you have applied to the existing NVSRAM are lost during the process of activation. You need to apply the custom settings to the NVSRAM again after the process of activation is complete.

== Step 5: Set the storage array to duplex

[.lead]
You use the script editor in the Enterprise Management Window (EMW) to set the storage array to duplex mode.

===== Before you begin

* You have installed SANtricity Storage Manager on a management station, so you can use the storage array's command line interface (CLI).
+
If SANtricity Storage Manager has not yet been installed, follow the instructions in the link:../config-linux/index.html[Linux express configuration], link:../config-windows/index.html[Windows express configuration], or link:../config-vmware/index.html[VMware express configuration] to download and install the software.

===== Steps

. Open the EMW for SANtricity Storage Manager on your management station.
. Select the storage array.
. Select *Tools* > *Execute Script*.
. Type the following command in the text box.
+
----
set storageArray redundancyMode=duplex;
----

. Select *Tools* > *Verify and Execute*.
. Type the following command in the text box.
+
----
reset controller [a];
----

. Select *Tools* > *Verify and Execute*.
+
After the controller reboots, an "`alternate controller missing`" error message is displayed. This message indicates that controller A has been successfully converted to duplex mode. This message persists until you install the second controller and connect the host cables.

== Step 6: Remove the controller blank

[.lead]
Remove the controller blank before you install the second controller. A controller blank is installed in controller shelves that have only one controller.

===== Steps

. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle for the controller blank until it releases, and then open the cam handle to the right.
. Slide the blank controller canister out of the shelf and set it aside.
+
When you remove the controller blank, a flap swings into place to block the empty bay.

== Step 7: Install second controller canister

[.lead]
You install a second controller canister to change a simplex configuration to a duplex configuration.

===== Before you begin

* You have a new controller canister with the same part number as the currently installed controller canister.
* Make sure you have labels to identify the new cables.
* Make sure you have all cables, transceivers, switches, and host bus adapters (HBAs) needed to connect the new controller ports.
+
For information about compatible hardware, refer to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/products/interoperability[NetApp Interoperability Matrix] or the http://hwu.netapp.com/home.aspx[NetApp Hardware Universe].

===== Steps

. Turn the controller canister over, so that the removable cover faces down.
. With the cam handle in the open position, slide the controller canister all the way into the controller shelf.
+

+
image:../media/legend_icon_01_maint-e2800.gif[] Controller canister image:../media/legend_icon_02_maint-e2800.gif[] Cam handle

. Move the cam handle to the left to lock the controller canister in place.
. Insert any SFP+ transceivers, and connect cables to the new controller.

== Step 8: Complete adding a second controller

[.lead]
You complete the process of adding a second controller by confirming that it is working correctly. Then, you can reinstall the duplex NVSRAM file, distribute volumes between the controllers, and collect support data.

===== Steps

. As the controller boots, check the controller LEDs and the seven-segment display.
+
When communication with the other controller is reestablished:

 ** The seven-segment display shows the repeating sequence *OS*, *OL*, *_blank_* to indicate that the controller is offline.
 ** The amber Attention LED remains on.
 ** The Host Link LEDs might be on, blinking, or off, depending on the host interface.
image:../media/28_dwg_attn_led_7s_display_maint-e2800.gif[]

+
image:../media/legend_icon_01_maint-e2800.gif[]Attention LED (amber) image:../media/legend_icon_02_maint-e2800.gif[] Seven-segment display image:../media/legend_icon_03_maint-e2800.gif[] Host Link LEDs

. Check the codes on the controller's seven-segment display as it comes online. If the display shows one of the following repeating sequences, immediately remove the controller.
 ** *OE*, *L0*, *_blank_* (mismatched controllers)
 ** *OE*, *L6*, *_blank_* (unsupported HIC)
*Attention:* *Possible loss of data access* -- If the controller you just installed shows one these codes, and the other controller is reset for any reason, the second controller could also lock down.
. Update the array's settings from simplex to duplex.
 .. Open the EMW in SANtricity Storage Manager on your local host.
 .. Select the storage array.
 .. Select *Tools* then *Execute Script*.
 .. Type in the following command:
+
set storageArray redundancyMode=duplex;

 .. Select *Tools* then *Verify and Execute*.
. From SANtricity System Manager, confirm that the controller's status is Optimal.
+
If the status is not Optimal or if any of the Attention LEDs are on, confirm that all cables are correctly seated, and check that the controller canister is installed correctly. If necessary, remove and reinstall the controller canister.
+
NOTE: If you cannot resolve the problem, contact technical support.

. Reinstall the duplex version of the NVSRAM file using either SANtricity System Manager or the Enterprise Management Window's (EMW) script editor.
+
This step ensures that both controllers have an identical version of this file.
+
IMPORTANT: *Risk of data loss or risk of damage to the storage array* -- Do not make changes to the storage array while the upgrade is occurring. Maintain power to the storage array.

 ** To use SANtricity System Manager:
  ... Under SANtricity OS Software upgrade, click *Begin Upgrade*.
  ... Click *Browse*, and select the SANtricity OS software file.
  ... Select the checkbox labeled *Transfer Controller NVSRAM file with upgrade*.
+
NOTE: You must install SANtricity OS software when you install a new NVSRAM file using SANtricity System Manager. If you already have the latest version of SANtricity OS software, you must reinstall that version.

  ... Click *Browse*, and select the duplex version of the Controller NVSRAM file (the file with "`D`" near the end of its name).
  ... Click *Start*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
The transfer of control operation begins.
 ** To use script editor in the Enterprise Management Window (EMW):
  ... Open the EMW in SANtricity Storage Manager on your local host.
  ... Select the storage array.
  ... Select *Tools* > *Execute Script*.
  ... Type the following command in the text box.
+
----
download storageArray NVSRAM file="filename" healthCheckMelOverride=FALSE;
----
+
In this command, filename is the file path and the file name for duplex version of the Controller NVSRAM file (the file with "`D`" in its name). Enclose the file path and the file name in double quotation marks (" "). For example:
+
----
file="C:\downloads\N280X-830834-D01.dlp"
----

  ... Select *Tools* > *Verify and Execute*.
The transfer of control operation begins.

. After the controllers reboot, optionally distribute volumes between controller A and the new controller B.
 .. Select *Storage* > *Volumes*.
 .. From the All Volumes tab, select *More* > *Change Ownership*.
 .. Type the following command in the text box: `change ownership`
+
The *Change Ownership* button is enabled.

 .. For each volume you want to redistribute, select *Controller B* from the *Preferred Owner* list.
+
image::../media/sam1130_ss_change_volume_ownership.gif[]
