summary: The steps to complete a battery replacement depend on whether you have a duplex configuration (two controllers) or a simplex configuration (one controller). If you have a duplex configuration, you place the affected controller online or, if you have a simplex configuration, you apply power to the controller shelf and confirm that all components are working correctly. Then, you can collect support data and resume operations.

The steps to complete a battery replacement depend on whether you have a duplex configuration (two controllers) or a simplex configuration (one controller). If you have a duplex configuration, you place the affected controller online or, if you have a simplex configuration, you apply power to the controller shelf and confirm that all components are working correctly. Then, you can collect support data and resume operations.

== Place controller online (duplex)

[.lead]
Place the controller online to confirm the storage array is working correctly. Then, you can collect support data and resume operations.

===== Before you begin

Perform this task only if your storage array has two controllers.

===== Steps

. As the controller boots, check the controller LEDs and the seven-segment display.
+
NOTE: The figure shows an example controller canister. Your controller might have a different number and a different type of host ports.
+
When communication with the other controller is reestablished:

 ** The seven-segment display shows the repeating sequence *OS*, *OL*, *_blank_* to indicate that the controller is offline.
 ** The amber Attention LED remains lit.
 ** The Host Link LEDs might be on, blinking, or off, depending on the host interface.

. Bring the controller online using either SANtricity System Manager or the Enterprise Management Window's (EMW) script editor:
 ** To use SANtricity System Manager:
  ... Select *Hardware*.
  ... If the graphic shows the drives, select *Show back of shelf*.
  ... Select the controller you want to place online.
  ... Select *Place Online* from the context menu, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
The system places the controller online.
 ** To use script editor in the EMW:
  ... Open the Enterprise Management Window (EMW) in SANtricity Storage Manager on your local host.
  ... Select the storage array.
  ... Select *Tools* > *Execute Script*.
  ... Type one of the following commands in the text box.
+
----
**For controller A:** set controller [a] availability=online;
----
+
----
**For controller B:** set controller [b] availability=online;
----

  ... Select *Tools* > *Verify and Execute*.
The system places the controller online.
. When the controller is back online, confirm that its status is Optimal, and check the controller shelf's Attention LEDs.
+
If the status is not Optimal or if any of the Attention LEDs are on, confirm that all cables are correctly seated, and check that the battery and the controller canister are installed correctly. If necessary, remove and reinstall the controller canister and the battery.
+
NOTE: If you cannot resolve the problem, contact technical support.

. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
 .. Select *Support* > *Support Center* > *Diagnostics*.
 .. Select *Collect Support Data*.
 .. Click *Collect*.

===== Result

Your battery replacement is complete. You can resume normal operations.

== Power up controller (simplex)

[.lead]
Power up the controller shelf to confirm that it is working correctly. Then, you can collect support data and resume operations.

===== Before you begin

Perform this task only if your storage array has one controller.

===== Steps

. Turn on the two power switches at the back of the controller shelf.
 ** Do not turn off the power switches during the power-on process, which typically takes 90 seconds or less to complete.
 ** The fans in each shelf are very loud when they first start up. The loud noise during start-up is normal.
. As the controller boots, check the controller LEDs and seven-segment display.
 ** The seven-segment display shows the repeating sequence *OS*, *Sd*, *_blank_* to indicate that the controller is performing Start-of-day (SOD) processing. After a controller has successfully booted up, its seven-segment display should show the tray ID.
 ** The amber Attention LED on the controller turns on and then turns off, unless there is an error.
 ** The green Host Link LEDs turn on.
