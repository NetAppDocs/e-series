[.lead]
Before you replace or add an E2800 controller, review the requirements and considerations.

Each controller canister contains a controller card, a battery, and an optional host interface card (HIC). You can add a second controller to a simplex configuration or replace a failed controller.

== Requirements for adding second controller

You can add a second controller canister to the simplex version of the following controller shelves:

* E2812 controller shelf
* E2824 controller shelf
* EF280 flash array

The figures show an example controller shelf before adding a second controller (one controller canister and a controller blank) and after adding a second controller (two controller canisters).

NOTE: The figures show example controller canisters; the host ports on your controller canisters might be different.

Before you add a second controller, you must have:

* A new controller canister with the same part number as the currently installed controller canister.
* A new HIC that is identical to the HIC in the currently installed controller canister (only necessary if the currently installed controller canister includes a host interface card.)
* All cables, transceivers, switches, and host bus adapters (HBAs) needed to connect the new controller ports.
+
For information about compatible hardware, refer to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/products/interoperability[NetApp Interoperability Matrix] or the http://hwu.netapp.com/home.aspx[NetApp Hardware Universe].

* Multipath driver installed on the host so that you can use both controllers. Refer to the link:../config-linux/index.html[Linux express configuration], link:../config-windows/index.html[Windows express configuration], or link:../config-vmware/index.html[VMware express configuration] for instructions.
* An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* A #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* Labels to identify the new cables.
* SANtricity Storage Manager installed on a management station, so you can use the storage array's command line interface (CLI).
+
If SANtricity Storage Manager has not yet been installed, follow the instructions in the link:../config-linux/index.html[Linux express configuration], link:../config-windows/index.html[Windows express configuration], or link:../config-vmware/index.html[VMware express configuration] to download and install the software.


== Requirements for replacing controller

When you replace a failed controller canister, you must remove the battery and HIC, if one is installed, from the original controller canister, and install them in the replacement controller canister.

You can determine if you have a failed controller canister in two ways:

* The Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager directs you to replace the controller canister.
* The amber Attention LED on the controller canister is on, indicating that the controller has a fault.

NOTE: The figure shows an example controller canister; the host ports on your controller canister might be different.

Before you replace a controller, you must have:

* A replacement controller canister with the same part number as the controller canister you are replacing.
* An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* Labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* SANtricity Storage Manager installed on a management station, so you can use the storage array's command line interface (CLI).
+
If this software has not yet been installed, follow the instructions in the link:../config-linux/index.html[Linux express configuration], link:../config-windows/index.html[Windows express configuration], or link:../config-vmware/index.html[VMware express configuration] to download and install it.

=== Duplex configuration requirements

If the controller shelf has two controllers (duplex configuration), you can replace a controller canister while your storage array is powered on and performing host I/O operations, as long as the following conditions are true:

* The second controller canister in the shelf has Optimal status.
* The *OK to remove* field in the Details area of the Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager displays *Yes*, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.

=== Simplex configuration requirements

If you have only one controller canister (simplex configuration), data on the storage array will not be accessible until you replace the controller canister. You must stop host I/O operations and power down the storage array.
