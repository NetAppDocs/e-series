E-Series systems include SANtricity software for storage provisioning and other tasks.

SANtricity software consists of these management interfaces:

* System Manager -- a web-based interface used for managing one controller in a storage array.
* Unified Manager -- a web-based interface used for viewing and managing all storage arrays in your network.
* Web Services Proxy -- a REST API used for viewing and managing all storage arrays in your network.
* Command line interface (CLI) -- a software application for configuring and monitoring storage arrays.

NOTE: EF600 and EF300 storage arrays do not support mirroring, thin volumes, or SSD Cache features.

== SANtricity System Manager

System Manager is web-based management software embedded on each controller. To access the user interface, point a browser to the controller's IP address. A setup wizard helps you get started with system configuration.

System Manager offers a variety of management features, including:

|===
a|
*Performance* image:../media/sam1130_icon_performance.gif[]

a|
View up to 30 days of performance data, including I/O latency, IOPS, CPU utilization, and throughput.

a|
*Storage* image:../media/sam1130_icon_volumes.gif[]

a|
Provision storage using pools or volume groups, and create application workloads.
a|
*Data protection* image:../media/sam1130_icon_async_mirroring.gif[]

a|
Perform backup and disaster recovery using snapshots, volume copy, and remote mirroring.
a|
*Hardware* image:../media/sam1130_icon_controllers.gif[]

a|
Check component status and perform some functions related to those components, such as assigning hot spare drives.
a|
*Alerts* image:../media/sam1130_icon_alerts.gif[]

a|
Notify administrators about important events occurring on the storage array. Alerts can be sent through email, SNMP traps, and syslog.
a|
*Access Management* image:../media/sam1140_icon_active_directory.gif[]

a|
Configure user authentication that requires users to log in to the system with assigned credentials.
a|
*System Settings* image:../media/sam1130_icon_settings.gif[]

a|
Configure other system performance features, such as SSD cache and autoload balancing.
a|
*Support* image:../media/sam1130_icon_support.gif[]

a|
View diagnostic data, manage upgrades, and configure AutoSupport, which monitors the health of a storage array and sends automatic dispatches to technical support.

== SANtricity Unified Manager

Unified Manager is web-based software used for managing your entire domain. From a central view, you can see status for all newer E-Series and EF-Series arrays, such as the E2800, EF280, EF300, E5700, EF570, and EF600. You can also perform batch operations on selected storage arrays.

Unified Manager is installed on a management server along with the Web Services Proxy. To access Unified Manager, you open a browser and enter the URL pointing to the server where the Web Services Proxy is installed.

Unified Manager offers a variety of management features, including:

|===
a|
*Discover storage arrays* image:../media/artboard_9.png[]

a|
Find and add the storage arrays you want to manage in your organization's network. You can then view the status of all storage arrays from a single page.
a|
*Launch* image:../media/artboard_11.png[]

a|
Open an instance of System Manager to perform individual management operations on a particular storage array.
a|
*Import Settings* image:../media/sam1130_icon_system.gif[]

a|
Perform a batch import from one storage array to multiple arrays, including settings for alerts, AutoSupport, and directory services.
a|
*Mirroring* image:../media/sam1130_icon_async_mirroring.gif[]

a|
Configure asynchronous or synchronous mirrored pairs between two storage arrays.
a|
*Manage Groups* image:../media/artboard_10.png[]

a|
Organize storage arrays into groups for easier management.
a|
*Upgrade Center* image:../media/sam1130_icon_upgrade_center.gif[]

a|
Upgrade the SANtricity OS software on multiple storage arrays.
a|
*Certificates* image:../media/sam1140_icon_certs.gif[]

a|
Create certificate signing requests (CSRs), import certificates, and manage existing certificates for multiple storage arrays.
a|
*Access Management* image:../media/sam1140_icon_active_directory.gif[]

a|
Configure user authentication that requires users to log in to Unified Manager with assigned credentials.

== SANtricity Web Services Proxy

The Web Services Proxy is a RESTful API server that can manage hundreds of new and legacy E-Series arrays. The proxy is installed separately on a Windows or Linux server.

Web Services includes API documentation that allows you to directly interact with the REST API. To access the Web Services API documentation, you open a browser and enter the URL pointing to the server where the Web Services Proxy is installed.

== Command line interface (CLI)

The command line interface (CLI) is a software application that provides a way to configure and monitor storage arrays. Using the CLI, you can run commands from an operating system prompt, such as the DOS C: prompt, a Linux operating system path, or a Solaris operating system path.
