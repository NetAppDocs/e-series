E-Series systems include SANtricity software for storage provisioning and other tasks.

SANtricity software consists of these management interfaces:

* System Manager -- a web-based interface used for managing one controller in a storage array.
* Unified Manager -- a web-based interface used for viewing and managing all storage arrays in your network.
* Web Services Proxy -- a REST API used for viewing and managing all storage arrays in your network.
* Command line interface (CLI) -- a software application for configuring and monitoring storage arrays.

NOTE: EF600 and EF300 storage arrays do not support mirroring, thin volumes, or SSD Cache features.

== SANtricity System Manager

System Manager is web-based management software embedded on each controller. To access the user interface, point a browser to the controller's IP address. A setup wizard helps you get started with system configuration.

System Manager offers a variety of management features, including:

== SANtricity Unified Manager

Unified Manager is web-based software used for managing your entire domain. From a central view, you can see status for all newer E-Series and EF-Series arrays, such as the E2800, EF280, EF300, E5700, EF570, and EF600. You can also perform batch operations on selected storage arrays.

Unified Manager is installed on a management server along with the Web Services Proxy. To access Unified Manager, you open a browser and enter the URL pointing to the server where the Web Services Proxy is installed.

Unified Manager offers a variety of management features, including:

|===
a|
image:../media/artboard_9.png[] *Discover storage arrays*  a|
Find and add the storage arrays you want to manage in your organization's network. You can then view the status of all storage arrays from a single page.


a|
image:../media/artboard_11.png[] *Launch*

a|
Open an instance of System Manager to perform individual management operations on a particular storage array.
a|
image:../media/sam1130_icon_system.gif[] *Import Settings*

a|
Perform a batch import from one storage array to multiple arrays, including settings for alerts, AutoSupport, and directory services.
a|
image:../media/sam1130_icon_async_mirroring.gif[] *Mirroring*

a|
Configure asynchronous or synchronous mirrored pairs between two storage arrays.
a|
image:../media/artboard_10.png[] *Manage Groups*

a|
Organize storage arrays into groups for easier management.
a|
image:../media/sam1130_icon_upgrade_center.gif[] *Upgrade Center*

a|
Upgrade the SANtricity OS software on multiple storage arrays.
a|
image:../media/sam1140_icon_certs.gif[] *Certificates*

a|
Create certificate signing requests (CSRs), import certificates, and manage existing certificates for multiple storage arrays.
a|
image:../media/sam1140_icon_active_directory.gif[] *Access Management*

a|
Configure user authentication that requires users to log in to Unified Manager with assigned credentials.

== SANtricity Web Services Proxy

The Web Services Proxy is a RESTful API server that can manage hundreds of new and legacy E-Series arrays. The proxy is installed separately on a Windows or Linux server.

Web Services includes API documentation that allows you to directly interact with the REST API. To access the Web Services API documentation, you open a browser and enter the URL pointing to the server where the Web Services Proxy is installed.

== Command line interface (CLI)

The command line interface (CLI) is a software application that provides a way to configure and monitor storage arrays. Using the CLI, you can run commands from an operating system prompt, such as the DOS C: prompt, a Linux operating system path, or a Solaris operating system path.
