E-Series storage arrays are available in several configurations and models. 

A storage array includes shelves, controllers, drives, software, and firmware. The array can be installed in a rack or cabinet, with customizable hardware for one or two controllers, in a 12-, 24-, or 60-drive shelf. You can connect the storage array to a SAN from multiple interface types and to a variety of host operating systems.

E-Series arrays are available in the following models:

* E2800 series -- entry-level hybrid
* EF280 series -- entry-level all flash
* EF300 series -- entry-level all flash, all NVMe
* E4000 series -- entry-level hybrid
* E5700 series -- midrange hybrid
* EF570 series -- midrange all flash
* EF600 series -- midrange all flash, all NVMe
* EF300C series -- entry-level all flash, all NVMe
* EF600C series -- midrange all flash, all NVMe

NOTE: For SANtricity OS 11.80GA and greater, all USB ports are disabled on the E2800, EF280, E5700, EF570, EF600/EF600C, and EF300/EF300C arrays.
