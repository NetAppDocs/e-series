Before you replace a DIMM in an EF300 or EF600 storage array, review the requirements and considerations.

You must replace a DIMM when a memory mismatch is present, or you have a failed DIMM. Be sure to verify the configuration of your EF300 or EF600 controller to ensure the correct DIMM size is replaced.

CAUTION: Be aware that the DIMMs in your storage array are fragile; improper handling can lead to damage.

Follow these rules to avoid damaging the DIMMs in your storage array:

* Prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD):
 ** Keep the DIMM in the ESD bag until you are ready to install it.
 ** Open the ESD bag by hand or cut the top off with a pair of scissors. Do not insert a metal tool or knife into the ESD bag.
 ** Keep the ESD bag and any packing materials in case you must return a DIMM later.
+
CAUTION: Always wear an ESD wrist strap grounded to an unpainted surface on your storage enclosure chassis.
* Handle DIMMs carefully:
 ** Always use two hands when removing, installing, or carrying a DIMM.
 ** Never force a DIMM into a shelf, and use gentle, firm pressure to completely engage the latch.
 ** Always use approved packaging when shipping DIMMs.
* Avoid magnetic fields. Keep DIMMs away from magnetic devices.
