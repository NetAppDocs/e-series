Follow these steps to replace a single controller in your EF300 or EF600 controller shelf.

== About this task
When you replace a failed controller canister, you must remove the battery, power supply, DIMMs, fans, and host interface card (HIC) from the original controller canister, and then install them in the replacement controller canister.

== Before you begin

* Review link:controllers_overview_supertask_concept[Requirements for EF300 or EF600 controller replacement].
* Determine if you have a failed controller canister in one of two ways:
** The Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager directs you to replace the controller canister.
** The amber Attention LED on the controller canister is on, indicating that the controller has a fault.

== Step 1: Prepare to replace controller

Prepare to replace a failed controller canister.

=.Steps

. Unpack the new controller canister, and set it on a flat, static-free surface.
+
Save the packing materials to use when shipping the failed controller canister.

. Locate the MAC address and FRU part number labels on the back of the controller canister.
. From SANtricity System Manager, locate the replacement part number for the controller canister you are replacing.
+
When a controller has a fault and needs to be replaced, the replacement part number is displayed in the Details area of the Recovery Guru. If you need to find this number manually, follow these steps:

 .. Select *Hardware*.
 .. Locate the controller shelf, which is marked with the controller icon image:../media/sam1130_ss_hardware_controller_icon_maint-ef600.gif[].
 .. Click the controller icon.
 .. Select the controller, and click *Next*.
 .. On the *Base* tab, make a note of the *Replacement Part Number* for the controller.

. Confirm that the replacement part number for the failed controller is the same as the FRU part number for the replacement controller.
+
CAUTION: *Possible loss of data access* -- If the two-part numbers are not the same, do not attempt this procedure. In addition, if the failed controller canister includes a host interface card (HIC), you must install that HIC into the new controller canister. The presence of mismatched controllers or HICs causes the new controller to lock down when you bring it online.

. Back up the storage array's configuration database.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to restore your configuration.

 .. In System Manager, navigate to the support page.
 .. Select the *Support Center* tab.
 .. Select *Diagnostics* tab.
 .. Select the *Collect Support Data*.

. If the controller is not already offline, take it offline now using SANtricity System Manager.
 .. Select *Hardware*.
 .. If the graphic shows the drives, select *Show back of shelf* to show the controllers.
 .. Select the controller that you want to place offline.
 .. From the context menu, select *Place offline*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.

+
NOTE: If you are accessing SANtricity System Manager using the controller you are attempting to take offline, a SANtricity System Manager Unavailable message is displayed. Select *Connect to an alternate network connection* to automatically access SANtricity System Manager using the other controller.
. Wait for SANtricity System Manager to update the controller's status to offline.
+
NOTE: Do not begin any other operations until after the status has been updated.

. Select *Recheck* from the Recovery Guru, and confirm that the *OK to remove* field in the Details area displays *Yes*, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.
