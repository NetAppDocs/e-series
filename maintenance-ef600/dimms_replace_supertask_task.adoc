To replace your DIMM you must verify the cache size of your controller, place the controller offline, remove the controller, remove the DIMMs, and install the new DIMMs in your controller. Then you can bring your controller back online and verify the storage array is working properly.

== Step 1: Determining if you need to replace DIMMs in a controller

[.lead]
You must verify the cache size of your controller before replacing the DIMMS.

. Access the `Storage-Array-Profile` for the controller.
 .. Select *Support Page* > *Support Resources* > *Storage Array Profile*.
. Select the *Data Cache Module* tab and locate the `Data Cache Module` field.
. If one of the following is present, note the DIMM's location and continue with remaining procedures in this section to replace the DIMMs on your controller:
 ** A failed DIMM, or a DIMM reporting *Data Cache Module* as not optimal.
 ** A DIMM with a mismatched *Data Cache Module* capacity.

== Step 2: Place controller offline

[.lead]
You must place the controller offline so you can safely remove and replace the DIMMs. You must back up the configuration and collect support data first. Then, you can take the controller offline.

* Make sure that no volumes are in use or that you have a multipath driver installed on all hosts using these volumes.
* Ensure you have verified the cache size of your controller and that your DIMMs need replaced.

. From SANtricity System Manager, review the details in the Recovery Guru to confirm that there is an issue with a mismatched memory and to ensure no other items must be addressed first.
. From the Details area of the Recovery Guru, determine which DIMM to replace.
. Back up the storage array's configuration database.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to restore your configuration.

 .. In System Manager, navigate to the support page.
 .. Select the *Support Center* tab.
 .. Select the *Diagnostics* tab.
 .. Select *Collect Support Data*.

. If the controller is not already offline, take it offline now using SANtricity System Manager.
 .. Select *Hardware*.
 .. If the graphic shows the drives, select *Show back of shelf* to show the controllers.
 .. Select the controller that you want to place offline.
 .. From the context menu, select *Place offline*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
+
NOTE: If you are accessing SANtricity System Manager using the controller you are attempting to take offline, a SANtricity System Manager Unavailable message is displayed. Select *Connect to an alternate network connection* to automatically access SANtricity System Manager using the other controller.
. Wait for SANtricity System Manager to update the controller's status to offline.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not begin any other operations until after the status has been updated.

. Select *Recheck* from the Recovery Guru, and confirm that the OK to remove field in the Details area displays Yes, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.

== Step 3: Remove controller canister

[.lead]
You remove the failed controller canister so you can replace your DIMMs with new ones.

* You must use labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* You have prepared a flat, static free work area.

. Put on an ESD wristband or take other antistatic precautions.
. Label each cable that is attached to the controller canister.
. Disconnect all the cables from the controller canister.
+
IMPORTANT: To prevent degraded performance, do not twist, fold, pinch, or step on the cables.

. Confirm that the Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is off.
. Squeeze the handles on either side of the controller, and pull back until it releases from the shelf.
+

. Using two hands and the handles, slide the controller canister out of the shelf. When the front of the controller is free of the enclosure, use two hands to pull it out completely.
+
IMPORTANT: Always use two hands to support the weight of a controller canister.
+

. Place the controller canister on a flat, static-free surface.

== Step 4: Remove DIMMs

[.lead]
If there is a memory mismatch present, you must replace the DIMMs in your controller.

* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.

. Remove the controller canister's cover by unscrewing the single thumbscrew and lifting the lid open.
. Confirm that the green LED inside the controller is off.
+
If this green LED is on, the controller is still using battery power. You must wait for this LED to go off before removing any components.

. Locate the DIMMs on your controller.
. Note the orientation of the DIMM in the socket so that you can insert the replacement DIMM in the proper orientation.
+
NOTE: A notch at the bottom of the DIMM helps you align the DIMM during installation.

. Slowly push apart on the two DIMM ejector tabs on either side of the DIMM to eject the DIMM from its slot, and then slide it out of the slot.
+

+

+
NOTE: Carefully hold the DIMM by the edges to avoid pressure on the components on the DIMM circuit board.
+
The number and placement of system DIMMs depends on the model of your system.

== Step 5: Install new DIMMs

[.lead]
You install a new DIMM to replace the DIMM previously installed in the controller.

* If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.

. Hold the DIMM by the corners, and align it to the slot.
+
The notch among the pins on the DIMM should line up with the tab in the socket.

. Insert the DIMM squarely into the slot.
+
The DIMM fits tightly in the slot, but should go in easily. If not, realign the DIMM with the slot and reinsert it.
+
NOTE: Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.

. Push carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the latches snap into place over the notches at the ends of the DIMM.
+
NOTE: DIMMs fit tightly. You might need to gently press on one side at a time and secure with each tab individually.
+

== Step 6: Reinstall controller canister

[.lead]
After installing the new DIMMs, you reinstall the controller canister into the controller shelf.

. Lower the cover on the controller canister and secure the thumbscrew.
. While squeezing the controller handles, gently slide the controller canister all the way into the controller shelf.
+
NOTE: The controller audibly clicks when correctly installed into the shelf.
+

. Reconnect all the cables.

== Step 7: Complete DIMMs replacement

[.lead]
You complete a DIMM replacement by placing the controller online to confirm the storage array is working correctly. Then, you can collect support data and resume operations.

. Place controller online.
 .. In System Manager, navigate to the hardware page.
 .. Select *Show back of controller*.
 .. Select the controller with the replaced DIMMs.
 .. Select *Place online* from the drop-down list.
. As the controller boots, check the controller LEDs.
+
When communication with the other controller is reestablished:

 ** The amber Attention LED remains on.
 ** The Host Link LEDs might be on, blinking, or off, depending on the host interface.

. When the controller is back online, confirm that its status is Optimal and check the controller shelf's Attention LEDs.
+
If the status is not Optimal or if any of the Attention LEDs are on, confirm that all cables are correctly seated and the controller canister is installed correctly. If necessary, remove and reinstall the controller canister.
+
NOTE: If you cannot resolve the problem, contact technical support.

. Click *Hardware* > *Support* > *Upgrade Center* to ensure that the latest version of SANtricity OS is installed.
+
As needed, install the latest version.

. Verify that all volumes have been returned to the preferred owner.
 .. Select *Storage* > *Volumes*. If current owner and preferred owner are not listed select *All volumes* > *Columns.* Select current owner and preferred owner, and then recheck to verify that volumes are distributed to their preferred owners.
 .. If volumes are all owned by preferred owner continue to Step 6.
 .. If none of the volumes are returned, you must manually return the volumes. Go to *Storage* > *Volumes* > *More* > *Redistribute volumes*.
 .. If only some of the volumes are returned to their preferred owners after auto-distribution or manual distribution you must check the recovery guru for host connectivity issues.
 .. If there is no recovery guru present or if following the recovery guru steps the volumes are still not returned to their preferred owners contact support.
. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
 .. Select *Support* > *Support Center* > *Diagnostics*.
 .. Select *Collect Support Data*.
 .. Click *Collect*.
