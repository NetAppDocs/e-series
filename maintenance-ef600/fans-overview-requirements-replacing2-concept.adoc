[.lead]
Before replacing a failed fan in an EF300 or EF600 array, review the following requirements.

* You have a replacement fan that is supported for your controller shelf or drive shelf model.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.

NOTE: If the Recovery Guru indicates that it is not OK to remove the fan, contact technical support.
