[.lead]
Before upgrading or replacing a host interface card (HIC) in a EF300, EF600, EF300C, or EF600C array, review the following requirements.

* You have scheduled a downtime maintenance window for this procedure. You cannot access data on the storage array until you have successfully completed this procedure. Because both controllers must have the same HIC configuration when they are powered on, the power must be off when you change HIC configuration. The presence of mismatched HICs causes the controller with the replacement HIC to lock down when you bring it online.
* You have all cables, transceivers, switches, and host bus adapters (HBAs) needed to connect the new host ports.

* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* You have a #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* You have labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* A management station with a browser that can access SANtricity System Manager for the controller. (To open the System Manager interface, point the browser to the controller's domain name or IP address.)
* Some HIC replacements or upgrades might require a host port protocol conversion. Follow the instructions in the xref:hpp-change-supertask-task.html[Change host protocol for an EF300 or EF600] for this requirement.
* EF300 controllers must have HIC port 2 filled with a HIC for host connectivity.
