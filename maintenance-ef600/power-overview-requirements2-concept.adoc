Before replacing a power supply in an EF300, EF600, EF300C, or EF600C array, review the following requirements.

* You must have a replacement power supply that is supported for your controller shelf or drive shelf model.

NOTE: Do not mix PSUs of different voltage types. Always replace like for like.

* You must have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
