If you plan to add a SAS expansion card to an EF300, review the following requirements.

* You must follow the link:../install-hw-ef600/index.html[Install and set up EF300 storage systems] to set up your controller.
* You must update your firmware to the latest version. To update your firmware, follow the instructions in the link:../upgrade-santricity/index.html[Upgrading SANtricity OS].
* You must schedule a downtime maintenance window for this procedure. You cannot access data on the storage array until you have successfully completed this procedure.
* You must perform this task with both controller canisters.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* You have a #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* You have labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* You have a management station with a browser that can access SANtricity System Manager for the controller. (To open the System Manager interface, point the browser to the controller's domain name or IP address.)

* EF300 controllers may have a SAS expansion card installed in port 1 to allow for drive tray expansion.
* To cable your SAS expansion, see link:../install-hw-cabling/index.html[Cabling E-Series hardware] for instructions.
