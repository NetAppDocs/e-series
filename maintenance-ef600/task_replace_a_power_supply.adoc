[.lead]
You can replace the power supplies when they fail in your EF300 or EF600 controller. If a power supply fails, you must replace it as soon as possible so the controller shelf has a redundant power source.

== Remove failed power supply

[.lead]
You remove a failed power supply so you can replace it with a new one. When you remove a power supply, you slide the part out of the shelf.

* You have reviewed the details in the Recovery Guru to confirm that there is an issue with the power supply. Select *Recheck* from the Recovery Guru to ensure no other items must be addressed first.
* You have checked that the amber Attention LED on the power supply is on, indicating that the power supply or its integrated fan has a fault.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.

. Unpack the new power supply, and set it on a level surface near the drive shelf.
+
Save all packing materials for use when returning the failed power supply.

. Disconnect the power cables:
 .. Open the power cord retainer, and then unplug the power cord from the power supply.
 .. Unplug the power cord from the power source.
. Locate the tab to the right of the power supply and press it towards the power supply unit.
