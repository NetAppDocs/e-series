You can access the Backups option in the left navigation panel of the SANtricity Cloud Connector application. The Backups option displays the Backups page, which allows you to create new image-based or file-based backup jobs.

Use the Backups page of the SANtricity Cloud Connector application to create and process backups of E-Series volumes. You can create image-based or file-based backups and then perform those operations immediately or at a later time. In addition, you can chose to perform full backups or incremental backups based on the last performed full backup. A maximum of six incremental backups can be performed based on the last full backup performed through the SANtricity Cloud Connector application.

NOTE: All timestamps for backup and restore jobs listed under the SANtricity Cloud Connector application use local time.
