== Cabinet features

[.lead]
The model 3040 40U cabinet has these standard features:

* A rear door that can be latched and locked
* Standard Electronic Industry Association (EIA) support rails that provide mounting holes for installing devices into a standard 48.3-cm (19-in.) wide cabinet
* Four roller casters and four adjustable leveling feet that are located beneath the cabinet for moving the cabinet and then leveling the cabinet in its final location
* A stability foot that stabilizes the cabinet after it is installed in its permanent location
* Access openings for interface cables
* Two AC power distribution units (PDUs) that provide integrated power connection and power handling capacity

The following figures show a front view (left) and a rear view (right) of the cabinet.

*Warning:* *Risk of bodily injury* -- If the bottom half of the cabinet is empty, do not install components in the top half of the cabinet. If the top half of the cabinet is too heavy for the bottom half, the cabinet might fall and cause bodily injury. Always install a component in the lowest available position in the cabinet.

WARNING: *Risk of bodily injury* -- Only move a populated cabinet with a forklift or adequate help from other persons. Always push the cabinet from the front to prevent it from falling over. A fully populated cabinet can weigh more than 2000 lb (909 kg). The cabinet is difficult to move, even on a flat surface. If you must move the cabinet along an inclined surface, remove the components from the top half of the cabinet, and make sure that you have adequate help.

NOTE: You cannot install E2860 or E5760 controller shelves or a DE460C drive shelf into a 3040 40U cabinet.

NOTE: If a 3040 cabinet is fully populated with DE6600 trays, it weighs more than 2756 lb (1250.1 kg).

== Power requirements and heat dissipation

[.lead]
The cabinet includes the following specifications for power and heat dissipation.

=== Power rating

The 3040 40U cabinet is rated at 200 VAC to 240 VAC at 50 Hz to 60 Hz, and operates to Â±10 percent of that range.

=== Power distribution units (PDUs)

The cabinet includes two identical AC power distribution units (PDUs), with each PDU providing up to 72A of usable power. The PDUs are mounted vertically at the back of the cabinet, and each PDU includes six 12A power banks. Each power bank contains four IEC 60320-C19 power outlets and a 15A circuit breaker. Each PDU has a total of 24 outlets and 6 circuit breakers.

Each of the two PDUs has three power entry boxes, which are located at the bottom of the cabinet. Each power entry box provides power to eight of the power outlets, as follows:

* Power entry box 1, which has power cord C1, supplies power to the bottom eight outlets
* Power entry box 2, which has power cord C2, supplies power to the middle eight outlets
* Power entry box 3, which has power cord C3, supplies power to the top eight outlets

The power entry boxes are labeled C1, C2, and C3 where the power cords connect to the modules.

== Maximum number of trays

[.lead]
The maximum number of trays that you can install in a 3040 40U cabinet depends on the height of each tray in rack units (U).

=== Tray heights in rack units (U)

Each rack unit is 1.75 inches (4.45 cm). For example, you can install up to ten 4U trays, up to twenty 2U trays, or a combination of 2U and 4U trays, up to 40U.
